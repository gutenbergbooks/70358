SISTER SUE AND THEIR<br>
TRICK DOG</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>A GRAND SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ting-a-ling!</span> rang the telephone in the
home of Bunny Brown and his sister Sue.
Ting-a-ling!</p>

<p>“I’ll answer it!” called Bunny, for he knew
his mother was down in the kitchen, helping
the maid get supper ready. It was almost
supper time. Bunny could tell this, he said,
“by the empty feeling in his little tummy.”</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling! rang the telephone again.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” fairly shouted Bunny, for he
heard the footsteps of his sister Sue coming
down the hall.</p>

<p>“I want to answer it!” cried Sue. “It’s my
turn, Bunny Brown!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“No, ’tisn’t! It’s mine!” and Bunny fairly
yelled this, he was so excited.</p>

<p>“Children! Children!” gently called their
mother, as she opened the kitchen door, thereby
letting out the delicious smell of baking
tarts, of which Bunny and his sister were very
fond. “Gently, children!” begged Mrs.
Brown. “I can’t have you answering the telephone
if you are going to shout like that.
Think what the person on the other end of the
wire would say if they heard you.”</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-a-ling! rang the bell again so
loudly and so long that it seemed to mean some
one was very impatient on the other end of the
line, though of course the girl in the central
office was doing the ringing.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” exclaimed Sue.</p>

<p>“You may both go,” decided Mrs. Brown.
“Sue, you may talk over the telephone that is
down in the library. Bunny, you go upstairs
and talk over the telephone in the sitting
room.”</p>

<p>“All right!” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>“This is fun!” laughed Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Perhaps she knew that she would get to the
telephone first, for Bunny had to run upstairs
from the downstairs hall. And Sue was first.
Taking the receiver off the hook she called:</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>Back came a voice she well knew. It was
her father speaking.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sue!” he cried, in his jolly tones.
“Is Bunny there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here!” answered Bunny for himself,
as by this time he had reached the upstairs
telephone—an extension of the one from
downstairs. Thus both children could talk to
their father at once and he to them.</p>

<p>“Listen quietly, children, and don’t talk
back until I ask you to,” cautioned Mr.
Brown. “Are you listening?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, too!” said Sister Sue.</p>

<p>The children wondered what it could all be
about. Why was their father so particular to
have them listen carefully?</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown caught enough of the talk from
Bunny and Sue to learn that it was her husband
who was on the other end of the wire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
He often called up from the boat dock just
before supper, to let her know he was on the
way home. Bunny and Sue had taken such
messages many times before, but this time
seemed a bit different.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you a question,” said Mr.
Brown, at his end of the wire. “Are you going
to be at home this evening, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I’m going to be at home!”
answered the little boy.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said his father. “Are you
going to be at home after supper, Sue?”</p>

<p>“Course I am, Daddy!” she replied, with a
laugh. “What makes you ask such a funny
question?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to know,” went on Mr.
Brown, and Bunny was sure he could hear his
father laughing back there in the office on the
boat and fish dock. “Now don’t forget!
Don’t go out after supper. And don’t go out
until I come home. Tell mother I’ll be there
soon.”</p>

<p>“But what for, Daddy?” asked Bunny.
“Why don’t you want us to go out?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to take us to the movies?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
asked Sue. For sometimes Daddy Brown did
this when there was a children’s play early
in the evening.</p>

<p>“Well, we may go to the movies,” said
Mr. Brown. “But perhaps you won’t care
to go after you see what you’re going to
see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what are we going to see?” cried
Bunny, catching at a new tone in his father’s
voice.</p>

<p>“That’s a secret!” replied Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, a secret!” cried both children.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” begged Sue.</p>

<p>“I will when I come home,” her father
promised.</p>

<p>“Is it a nice secret?” Bunny wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Mr. Brown. “You
can tell better after you see it. But I haven’t
time to talk any more now. Yes, Bunker Blue,
I’m coming,” he said in a side voice which
Bunny and Sue could hear. Bunker Blue
was a red-haired boy who worked at Mr.
Brown’s boat and fish dock. Then their
father ended with: “Now don’t forget, Bunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and Sue. Don’t go out this evening. Wait
for the surprise.”</p>

<p>“I will!” promised Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“I will!” promised his sister Sue.</p>

<p>They hung up the telephone receivers, and
after that you could not have gotten them
away from the house even if a lot of fire-engines
had raced by outside.</p>

<p>“Well, children, what was it?” asked Mrs.
Brown, as Bunny came sliding down the banister
as the quickest way of reaching the first
floor, while Sue ran out from the library.
“Is daddy coming home soon?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be here right away,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“And he’s going to bring a surprise!” burst
out Sue. “A surprise! A surprise! Oh,
Mother, what do you s’pose it is?” she asked,
her eyes big with wonder.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” and Mrs. Brown
smiled. “Maybe it’s a lollypop or a picture
book.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! They wouldn’t be surprises!”
scoffed Bunny.</p>

<p>“But they’d be nice just the same!” Sue
made haste to say, fearing that Bunny was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
grateful enough. “Picture books and lollypops
are very nice.”</p>

<p>“But they’re not zactly <i>surprises</i>!” said
Bunny. “I guess daddy has a better surprise
than that.”</p>

<p>The children could hardly wait for their
father to come home. Again and again they
raced to the front door, thinking they heard
him coming, but it was a “false alarm.” Then
they went out on the front steps to look down
the street and wait. After a while Mr. Brown
came along.</p>

<p>“I see him!” shouted Bunny.</p>

<p>“I see him!” cried Sue, like an echo.</p>

<p>“But he hasn’t got any surprise,” said
Bunny, a bit sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Maybe he has it in his pocket,” suggested
Sue. Like her brother she had noticed that
Mr. Brown carried nothing in his hands.</p>

<p>Down the street in the early summer evening
raced Bunny Brown and his sister Sue to
meet their father. Laughing, he caught them
up in his arms, one on either side, and carried
them along with him.</p>

<p>“Though you’re getting so big I’ll soon have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
to stop this,” he said, with another laugh.
“My, but you’re getting heavy!”</p>

<p>“Daddy! Daddy! Where’s the surprise?”
asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you bring it? You promised!” said
Sue.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t bring it. But it’s coming right
after supper,” said Daddy Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I can guess what it is! Toby,
our Shetland pony, is coming back!” cried
Bunny.</p>

<p>The pony had been sent away to the doctor’s
some time before this.</p>

<p>“Is Toby coming back?” asked Sue. “Is
that the surprise, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t the surprise,” he answered,
as he set the children down inside the fence in
front of the house. “Now don’t try to guess
any more, or you won’t be able to eat any supper.
As soon as we have eaten the surprise
will come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, couldn’t we have it first?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Please!” begged Sue.</p>

<p>“No, it will be best to eat first and have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
surprise afterward,” their father said.
“Otherwise you might not eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what can it be?” wondered Sue.</p>

<p>“It surely is a big surprise!” declared
Bunny.</p>

<p>Whether Daddy Brown told Mother
Brown in a whisper what the surprise was, I
do not know. I rather think he did before he
sat down to supper. But the children were
kept guessing, and you can imagine how impatient
they were.</p>

<p>But finally the meal was over and as Mr.
Brown looked at his watch and pushed back
his chair there came a ring at the front doorbell.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Daddy, as the maid started to
answer. “No, you children sit still,” he ordered,
shaking his finger at them. “If this is
the surprise—and I think it is—I want to introduce
you to it in the right way.”</p>

<p>So, more impatient than before, Bunny and
Sue kept their seats while their father went
into the front hall. They heard him open the
door and then a man’s voice asked:</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Jim Denton live here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“No, there is no one of that name on this
street,” answered Mr. Brown. “What business
is he in?” asked the children’s father.
And as they rightly guessed this was not the
visitor Mr. Brown expected and as it could
not be the surprise, Bunny and Sue felt that
they might take a peep at the front door.
Their mother nodded her permission.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue saw their father talking to
an old and ragged man. He was almost as
ragged as a tramp, and yet he did not seem
to be a tramp.</p>

<p>“What does this Mr. Denton do that you
are asking about?” inquired Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“He’s in the circus business,” answered the
old man, and Bunny and Sue felt sorry for
him, he looked so sad and tired. “I used to
know him. We were in the show business together.
I was thinking he might help
me——”</p>

<p>“Are you hungry?” asked Mr. Brown kindly.
“If you want food——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you, I’m not quite as badly
off as that—yet. Though I may be,” answered
the old and ragged man in a sad voice. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
I could find Mr. Denton he might help me to
get back in the show business again. Some
one told me he lived around here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he does,” said Mr. Brown,
as the children stood behind him in the hall.
“I know all the men around here and there
is no Mr. Denton who was in the circus business.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll have to search further,”
said the weary old man. “I’m sorry I bothered
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was no bother,” said Mr. Brown.
“I thought you were some one I was expecting.
Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” echoed the old man, and
Bunny and Sue felt very sorry for him as he
went feebly down the steps and shuffled off.</p>

<p>“Well, that wasn’t the surprise after all,”
said Mr. Brown, as he shut the door.</p>

<p>“When will it come?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Soon now, I think,” was the answer.</p>

<p>They all went back to the dining room.
Mr. Brown was telling about the old man
who was seeking a Mr. Denton in the circus
business when again the front doorbell rang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“This is the surprise, I’m sure!” cried
Daddy Brown. “Now stay here, children,
until I call to you to open the door into the
hall,” he warned.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue, so impatient they could
hardly keep still, waited. They heard the
front door open. They heard their father
talking. Then came a funny, squeaking,
whining sound.</p>

<p>“Oh, what can it be?” murmured Sue.</p>

<p>Then came a knock on the door leading
from the dining room into the hall.</p>

<p>“You may open!” called their father.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue together turned the knob,
and into the room stalked a funny little chap,
wearing a red cap, a white coat, and blue
trousers. In he stepped and began dancing
around.</p>

<p>“There’s your surprise!” cried Daddy
Brown.</p>

<small>PATTER’S TRICKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunny Brown</span> and his sister Sue were
really surprised at Daddy Brown’s surprise.
Never had they been so astonished. They
watched the queer little chap with his red,
white and blue suit dancing around the room.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“Where did you get him?” Sue wanted to
know. “Is he for us to keep?”</p>

<p>“Do you want to keep him?” asked Mr.
Brown, laughing at the surprise of his two
children.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s lovely!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“But who is he?” asked Bunny again.</p>

<p>And while the children are trying to guess
I will tell my new readers a little about Bunny
and Sue so they will, I hope, be better friends
from knowing them better.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Walter Brown lived with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Bunny and Sue—their only children—in the
eastern city of Bellemere, on Sandport Bay,
not far from the ocean. Mr. Brown owned a
boat and fish dock, and Bunker Blue, the red-haired
boy, was one who helped run it. Sometimes
Uncle Tad, who had fought “in the
war,” as Bunny told his chums, worked down
at the dock, and often the old soldier would
go on little trips with the children.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown rented boats, and he sold fish
when the men he hired were lucky enough to
catch any. He also sold clams, crabs, and
lobsters. Bunny and Sue knew how to catch
crabs. But to get lobsters the boats had to
go far out to sea, and the children were not
allowed to do this unless daddy was with
them.</p>

<p>In the first book of this series, called
“Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue,” I related
to you some of the many adventures of this
pair. After the happenings related in that
book, Bunny and Sue went to Grandpa’s farm,
they played circus, they went to their Aunt
Lu’s city home and to camp. After some adventures
in the big woods, the children were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
taken on an automobile trip, and when they
came back, to their delight, their father
bought them a Shetland pony.</p>

<p>Having a pony, Bunny thought it would be
a good idea to give a “show,” so he and Sue
did that, and on their next vacation they were
taken to Christmas Tree Cove. A trip to the
sunny South was taken just before the children
helped Mrs. Golden, who owned a little grocery,
and in the book just before the one you
are now reading—a book named “Bunny
Brown and His Sister Sue Keeping Store”—I
told you all the children did to aid Mrs.
Golden.</p>

<p>And now we come to the present time, when
Bunny and Sue were given a glad surprise by
their father.</p>

<p>Around and around the room waltzed and
danced the funny little chap in his red, white
and blue clown suit, and Bunny and Sue kept
asking:</p>

<p>“Who is he? What is he?”</p>

<p>Bunny was just going to guess that it was a
monkey dressed up like a little dwarf when
from beneath the cap came a sharp:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Bow-wow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a dog!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“Is it a dog, Daddy?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“It sounds like one,” laughed Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“And is he ours to keep?” the little boy
questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mr. Brown. “He is your
dog. Down, sir!” he commanded, and the
dog dropped to all fours and stood looking at
Mr. Brown as if for further orders.</p>

<p>“Dead dog!” cried the children’s father.</p>

<p>Instantly the dog stretched out as if he had
lost all life.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a trick dog!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“Is he a trick dog?” asked Sue. She wanted
her father to tell her for sure. And Mr.
Brown answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a trick dog, and rather valuable
I think.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get him, Daddy?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“I took him for a debt,” was the reply. “A
Frenchman, who had trained this trick dog,
owed me some money for fish and for boat
hire. I had about given up all hope of ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
getting my money, for the Frenchman said he
was so poor he thought he could not pay for a
long time. Then he asked me if I had children
and if they loved animals. And when I
said I had, and when I told him, Bunny and
Sue, how fond you were of your dog Splash,
when you had him, and how you liked your
Shetland pony, Toby, the man asked me to take
this trick dog in place of the money he owed
me.”</p>

<p>“And you did,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” admitted Mr. Brown. “It
was the only way to get anything from the
poor Frenchman. So I had him bring the
dog to the dock this afternoon, and then he
showed me how to make him go through some
of his tricks. Then I telephoned to you
about the surprise.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely surprise,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Who brought the dog up from the dock?”
Bunny asked.</p>

<p>“I left him for Bunker Blue to bring,” explained
Mr. Brown. “And when that old
man, who inquired about the circus, rang the
bell, I thought that was Bunker. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
came a little later. And now, do you like
your new trick dog?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I love him!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“So do I!” declared Bunny. “May I pat
him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the dog is quite friendly and
tame,” said Mr. Brown, and soon Bunny
Brown and his sister Sue had made friends
with their new pet given up by the poor
Frenchman in payment of his debt.</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Bunny, as he
took the cap off the dog’s head in order to
see the animal better.</p>

<p>“Who’s, the Frenchman?” asked Mr.
Brown. “His name is Jean Baptiste
Foulard.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean the dog’s name,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has a long French name, which
means, in our language, ‘the little dog who
brings the milk bottle in every morning,’”
said Mr. Brown, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“What a cute name!” exclaimed Mrs.
Brown. “Couldn’t the children call him
that?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s too long,” said her husband.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
“That name would be a regular tongue-twister.
They had much better call the dog
some simpler name.”</p>

<p>“And did he really bring the milk bottle in
every morning?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, so the Frenchman said,” answered
Mr. Brown. “The dog was taught to do that.
Every morning, when his master opened the
door, the dog would go out and lift in the bottle
of milk. It was only a small bottle, and
he could easily get the top in his mouth.
Then he would lap some of the milk out of a
saucer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish we could see him do it!” cried
Sue.</p>

<p>“He will do that and many other tricks,”
her father explained. “The Frenchman was
very sorry to part with his dog, but he
did not want to sell him to some one who
might not be kind, and so he gave him to
me, and now he does not owe me any more
money.”</p>

<p>“I know what we can do with this trick
dog,” said Bunny, after thinking it over for a
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“What?” asked his mother. But before
Bunny could answer Sue broke in to ask:</p>

<p>“Where is the Frenchman now, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“He has gone away,” Mr. Brown replied.
“Why do you ask, Sue?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I thought maybe he might come
back and take our trick dog away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he wouldn’t do that,” said Mr.
Brown. “This Frenchman is honest. After
he gave me the dog to pay his debt he would
not take the animal back. Now I must show
you what tricks the dog can do and you can
practice putting him through them.”</p>

<p>Once again the dog marched around and
danced. Then Mr. Brown gave him a stick
which the dog carried like a gun, playing
soldier. After that the dog rolled over, he
turned a somersault, he “played dead,” and
he “said his prayers,” by crouching in the seat
of a chair and putting his forepaws on the
back, with his head down between them.</p>

<p>“He can do other tricks,” said Mr. Brown.
“But now, children, what are you going to
call him? I think you had better take some
other name than the long French one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Bunny thought for a moment and then said:</p>

<p>“We can call him Patter!”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“’Cause his feet patter so on the floor when
he dances,” said Bunny. And truly the toenails
of the dog did make a queer little “pattering”
sound as he waltzed around.</p>

<p>“I think that’s a nice name,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Then we shall call this trick dog Patter,”
decided Mr. Brown. “I’ll have a collar
made for him with his name on it.”</p>

<p>Sue clapped her hands in delight and
Bunny looked pleased. They made Patter
do more tricks, and really the Frenchman’s
dog seemed very smart.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach him more tricks,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>But just then, when Patter was doing the
trick of pretending to be a soldier dog, there
came another ring at the doorbell.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>TOBY COMES BACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who</span> you s’pose that is?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Sue. “I hope
maybe it isn’t that Frenchman come to take
his dog back,” she went on, with a look at her
father.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Mr. Brown. “The
Frenchman will not take your Patter back. I
made him promise if I took the dog for the
money that was owing to me that it would be
mine forever. And the Frenchman agreed
to this. You won’t lose your dog, Bunny and
Sue.”</p>

<p>The children seemed relieved at this, but
still they wondered who had rung the doorbell.
Mary, the maid, had gone to see who
was calling, and after Patter had marched
around like a soldier dog, Mary came back in
the dining room to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“There’s a man out in the hall who wants
to see you, Mr. Brown.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked the children’s
father.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t say. Called himself a
stranger,” said Mary. “He said he wouldn’t
keep you but a minute.”</p>

<p>Again Bunny and Sue looked worriedly at
each other. In spite of what Daddy Brown
said, this might, after all, be the Frenchman
coming back after his trick dog. Certainly
Patter was a dog that any one would want,
he was so cute and wise.</p>

<p>“A stranger?” said Mr. Brown, and he
seemed very thoughtful. “I can’t imagine
who it can be. But I’ll see him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder——” began Mrs. Brown,
and then she stopped. She was thinking perhaps
it might be the old man who, earlier in
the evening, had stopped to inquire about a
Mr. Denton who was in the circus business.
And, as it happened, while it was not this
old man again, the stranger’s visit was about
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown went out into the hall, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
he left the door open Bunny, Sue and their
mother could hear what was said.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me?” said Mr. Brown,
as he looked at the caller who, indeed, was a
stranger to him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “My name is Merton.
A little while ago I saw an old man
come out of your house here as I was waiting
for a friend on the street. Do you know who
this old man is?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t even know his name,” said
Mr. Brown. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because he was just now hurt—run down
by an automobile,” said Mr. Merton. “I
saw it happen. The police came and took the
old man away in the ambulance. No one
seemed to know who he was, and I remembered
that he had come out of your house.
So I told the police maybe you knew him, and
if you did I’d find out about it.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know him,” said Mr. Brown.
“I’m sorry he was hurt. He’s as much a
stranger to me as you are, Mr. Merton. He
came here to inquire about a Jim Denton who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
used to be in the circus business; but I know
no such man.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said Mr. Merton. “Well,
I won’t trouble you any further. I don’t suppose
much can be done for the old man. He
doesn’t seem to have any friends.”</p>

<p>“What hospital did they take him to?”
asked Mr. Brown, for there were two not far
from Bellemere. “I might go to see him,
poor chap!”</p>

<p>Mr. Merton told what hospital it was and
then left, for there was nothing more he could
do, though he said he would inquire around
and see if he could locate “Jim Denton,” or
any one else who knew the old man.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” said Mrs. Brown, when her
husband came back into the dining room,
where Bunny and Sue were patting their new
trick dog. “I wish we could do something
for him.”</p>

<p>“I could give him some money from my
bank,” offered Bunny.</p>

<p>“So could I!” chimed in Sue.</p>

<p>“I guess he doesn’t need money—not as long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
as he is in the hospital, anyhow,” remarked
their father. “I wonder who this Jim Denton,
a circus man, can be. And I wonder
why the old man wants to find him.”</p>

<p>“You might ask the Frenchman who gave
you the dog,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“How would he know?” inquired her husband.</p>

<p>“As he trained this dog to do tricks, he
might know some circus people, for they have
trained and trick dogs in a circus.”</p>

<p>“We had one in ours, when we played circus!”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>“But Patter is a better trick dog than Splash
ever was,” added Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, Patter is a good trick dog,” said Mr.
Brown. “But I hardly think, my dear,” he
added to his wife, “that Mr. Foulard would
know anything about circus men. Anyhow,
the Frenchman has gone many miles from
here.”</p>

<p>In a way Bunny and Sue were glad to hear
this, for they thought there would be less danger
of the Frenchman coming back to take
away Patter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Well, I feel sorry for the old man,” went
on Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said her husband, “and I’ll go
to see him in the hospital. I’ll try to find out
where this circus man is whom he wants to
find.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the evening was spent
by Bunny and Sue playing with their trick
dog. Patter loved children and was never
happier than when performing for them.
But even a trick dog may get tired, and
Mr. Brown knew this for, after a while, he
said:</p>

<p>“Now, children, it is time for you to go to
bed, and Patter must have some sleep, also.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, could he sleep with me?”
begged Bunny.</p>

<p>“No, I want him to sleep with me—my bed
is bigger!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“It is not good for dogs to sleep with boys
and girls,” said Daddy Brown. “I will make
a bed for Patter in the kitchen. He is used
to sleeping in the kitchen, the Frenchman told
me. Later on we’ll make a bed in the woodhouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Bunny and Sue were a bit disappointed, but
they felt that Daddy knew best. So, after
some good-night pats given their dog, the children
went up to their rooms, and Patter was
put in a bed in a snug corner of the kitchen.
His clown suit of red, white and blue was
taken off and put away for special occasions.</p>

<p>“We’ll see you in the morning, Patter!”
called Bunny.</p>

<p>“An’ we’ll have you do some more tricks,”
said Sue.</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll teach you some new ones,” concluded
Bunny.</p>

<p>Downstairs Mr. and Mrs. Brown talked
over what had happened that evening since
the trick dog had come home.</p>

<p>“Patter will be a great pet for Bunny and
Sue,” remarked their mother. “They miss
Splash so, especially since Toby the pony had
to be sent away.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Mr. Brown, “that
I had a letter to-day from the farmer who is
taking care of Toby. The pony may soon be
back.”</p>

<p>“Is he cured?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Yes,” answered Mr. Brown, and he
laughed a little.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?” asked his
wife.</p>

<p>“At what Sue says when she speaks about the
pony,” answered Mr. Brown. “She says he
was ‘sent away to cure something he had in his
hair that fell out.’ I always laugh when I
think of that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was queer,” said Mrs. Brown, with
a smile. “But it was true—Toby’s hair did
fall out.”</p>

<p>“The farmer says that is ended now, and
that Toby is well again,” remarked Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>“I’m glad, for the sake of the children,”
said Mrs. Brown. “And I do hope you may
be able to do something for that poor old
man.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” promised her husband.</p>

<p>Then it was time to go to bed, and after seeing
that Patter was all right in the kitchen,
Mr. Brown turned out the lights.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Mr. and Mrs.
Brown were awakened by hearing Sue call:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Now stop, Bunny Brown! Mother, make
Bunny stop!”</p>

<p>“Bunny, what are you doing?” asked Mr.
Brown, for sometimes the little boy plagued
and teased his small sister.</p>

<p>“I’m not doing anything,” Bunny answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, too!” cried Sue. “He’s putting
a cold sponge from the bathroom on my face.
It’s a wet sponge! Make him stop, Mother!
Make Bunny stop!” begged Sue.</p>

<p>“I’m not doing a thing to her! How can
I when I’m in my own bed?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>And Daddy Brown, getting up, found that
this was so. Bunny was in his own little bed.
But who was bothering Sue? Some one must
be, for she kept crying:</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown hurried into the little girl’s
room, and what do you suppose he found
there?</p>

<p>I think you have guessed.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the trick dog, Patter! He had
gone upstairs, and, standing on his hind feet
at the side of Sue’s bed, he was licking her
face with his cold, wet, red tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Oh, Patter, I didn’t know it was you!”
cried Sue, for she had called out about Bunny
before opening her eyes. “I didn’t know it
was you.”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked the trick dog, wagging
his tail for joy.</p>

<p>“Is Patter there?” cried Bunny, and he ran
into his sister’s room. Then he hugged the dog
and so did Sue until their father told them,
early as it was, they had better get up, as he
did not like a dog in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue dressed quickly and ran out
to play in the yard with Patter before breakfast.
Then came the meal, and you may be
sure Patter had his, a full plate in the corner
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll teach him some new tricks,” said
Bunny, when he and Sue were again romping
with the dog. “I’ll teach him to walk on his
front legs. He walks on his hind legs fine,
but I want him to walk on his front legs.”</p>

<p>“That’s harder,” said Sue, for they had
tried to teach this to their other dog, Splash.
“Maybe he’ll tip over.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! It’ll be only a somersault if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
does!” laughed Bunny. “Come on, Patter,
learn to walk on your front legs!” he called.</p>

<p>He and Sue were holding up the hind legs
of their trick dog, to make him learn how to
walk on his front ones, when a voice from the
street called:</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Brown live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bunny, without looking
up, for often delivery men asked that question.</p>

<p>The next moment, however, Sue cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, Toby has come back! Toby has come
back!”</p>

<small>TOBY AND PATTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunny Brown</span> was so surprised by what
his sister called, about Toby the pony coming
back, that the little boy let go of Patter’s hind
legs, which had been raised in the air to try
to make him walk on his front legs.</p>

<p>Down fell Patter’s legs, so suddenly
that if Patter had been a little boy or girl I’m
sure he would have grunted, or perhaps he
might even have cried. But as he was a dog,
though a trick dog, Patter whined a little and
then barked:</p>

<p>“Bow-wow-wuff!”</p>

<p>Perhaps that meant he didn’t like to be
treated so. But Bunny did not stop to think
about the new trick dog just then. Bunny ran
after Sue, who was heading for the gate, outside
of which stood a man with a pony and a
cart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>The man had gotten out of the cart and was
now looking at Bunny Brown and his sister
Sue and their trick dog.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Brown lives here,” said the man,
“I reckon this is his pony, for it’s where I was
told to leave it.”</p>

<p>“It’s our pony,” said Bunny, “and thank
you for bringing him back to us. His name
is Toby.”</p>

<p>“So I was told,” said the man. “Well,
here he is,” and he led the tiny horse in
through the gate that Bunny and his sister
opened.</p>

<p>“Is he all cured?” Sue wanted to know.
“His hair won’t fall and come out any more,
will it?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the man, “his hair won’t
fall out any more. He has been boarding at
our farm for some time, and now he’s cured.
Your father told me to leave him here for you.
I just stopped at the office and he told me to
bring the pony up. So here I am.”</p>

<p>“And we’re glad of it!” cried Sue. “Now
we have a pony and a trick dog, and we’re
going to give a show, maybe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Is that a trick dog?” asked the farmer’s
hired man, for he it was who had brought
Toby home.</p>

<p>“Yes, he does lots of tricks,” and Bunny held
his arms in a circle so Patter could jump
through them.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t know he could do that!” exclaimed
Sue, as she watched this trick.</p>

<p>“I didn’t, either,” admitted Bunny. “But
Splash used to do this trick, and I thought I’d
try it for Patter. And he did it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, little man, he did!” said the
farmer’s man, with a laugh. “And now, if
you’ll just call your mother, so I know it’s all
right for me to leave the pony with you, I’ll
be getting back.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was on her way out to the yard,
for she had seen the man driving up with the
pony and cart. She now spoke to him and
learned that he had already seen Mr. Brown
at the dock office, where the children’s father
had gone after breakfast.</p>

<p>“May we take a ride in the pony cart?”
asked Bunny of his mother, when the farmer’s
man had gone and it was afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Yes,” was the answer. “Toby is well and
strong again, more healthy than before, the
man said, and I guess he can pull you in the
cart. But don’t go too far away.”</p>

<p>“We won’t!” promised Bunny and Sue.
“May Patter come with us?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>His mother said the trick dog might go, and
soon the little boy and girl, with Patter sitting
between them, were driving down a quiet
street near the Brown home.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t run Toby too much at first,”
said Bunny, who was holding the reins.</p>

<p>“No, ’specially after he just got over the
falling-out-hair sickness,” agreed Sue. “Can
I drive a little now, Bunny?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her brother. “Oh, wouldn’t
it be fun to teach Patter to hold the lines in
his mouth and drive Toby?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Lots of fun!” agreed Sue. “But we’d better
not do that until Patter and Toby get to
know each other better,” she added. “Let me
drive now.”</p>

<p>So Bunny gave his sister the reins on a quiet
street where automobiles seldom came.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the tricks I’m going to teach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Patter for the show we’ll have,” said Bunny,
after a while.</p>

<p>“What show?” Sue wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get up a performance,” said
Bunny, as if nothing could be easier. “Maybe
it’ll be a circus like the one we had once, or
maybe we’ll give a show in the opera house.
But we’ll do something to show off Patter, and
I’ll teach him to drive Toby.”</p>

<p>The children had a good time riding
around in the pony cart, and Toby seemed so
fresh and strong, as if willing to trot for miles
and miles, that Bunny and Sue really didn’t
want to turn around and go back home. But
they did at last, and to their surprise they saw
their father at the gate.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy!” cried Bunny, as Sue guided
the pony and cart through the gate, “what
makes you come home so early?” For it was
not time for supper yet, and the boy knew his
father did not close the office on the boat and
fish dock until nearly supper time.</p>

<p>“I came home to ask your mother if she had
anything good to eat that she wanted to send
the poor man in the hospital,” answered Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Brown. “The old man who wants to find a
circus,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Are you going to the hospital?” asked Sue.
“May I come?”</p>

<p>“I want to go, too!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I’ll take you both,” said
Mr. Brown. “As long as you have the pony
cart out and while Toby seems so fresh and
strong, I’m sure it will do no harm if I ride
with you to the hospital in the cart. It isn’t
far and it’s a level road the whole way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll all go to the hospital!” cried Sue,
clapping her hands in joy. Of course, for a
well person to go to the hospital is not as bad
as when a sick person has to go. I think if
Sue had been ill or hurt and had to go to the
hospital she might not have been so jolly.
“We’ll all go!” she said. “Bunny and Daddy
and I and Patter!”</p>

<p>“No, Patter mustn’t go,” said Mr. Brown,
with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“He might make a disturbance,” said Mr.
Brown. “Besides, Patter is a bit strange yet,
and when you drive down the main streets of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the town he might jump out of the pony cart
and run away. You wouldn’t want that to
happen, would you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>So Patter was made to get out of the pony
cart, though he did not want to. Patter was
shut up in the woodhouse for a time, and Mr.
Brown took the place left vacant by the dog.
Then with his two children Mr. Brown drove
to the hospital where the old man had been
taken after the accident.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue would have gone right into
the rooms where the sick and injured patients
lay in their white beds, only their father
thought it unwise. There are sad sights to
see, and sad sounds to hear in a hospital, and
it was not good for Bunny and Sue to see and
hear them.</p>

<p>So they waited outside in the pony cart
while their father went into the big red brick
building, carrying the basket of good things
Mrs. Brown had put up for the unknown man.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, Mr. Brown could
not see the patient, who was badly hurt and
out of his head, not knowing what he was saying.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
So the basket of good things was left
until such time as the dainties could be eaten.</p>

<p>Back home in the pony cart rode Daddy,
Bunny and Sue, and Toby was so strong from
his long rest on the farm that he easily pulled
the man and children.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bunny!” “Hello, Sue!” called
some boys and girls on the street, not far from
the Brown house as the children were driving
back. “Is that a new pony?” asked one boy.</p>

<p>“No, it’s just old Toby,” answered Bunny,
and his father waved his hand at George Watson
and Harry Bentley, who were playing
with Mary Watson and Sadie West.</p>

<p>“He looks fine!” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Looks as if he’d just been painted!” and
George laughed at the idea of painting a
horse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was waiting for her family
when they returned in the pony cart, and at
once asked about the old man.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but he was so ill I couldn’t see
him,” explained her husband. “I’ll go again,
however.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown got out of the pony cart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
went back to his dock, but as it was yet early
Bunny and Sue were allowed to ride around a
bit longer, before it was time for supper and
then bed.</p>

<p>“We’ll let Patter out now, as long as we
are going to ride only around the block,” explained
Bunny, and he opened the shed
where the trick dog had been shut so that he
wouldn’t follow after the pony cart.</p>

<p>With joyous barks Patter rushed out ahead
of Bunny. Reaching the pony cart the dog began
racing around it, barking excitedly. The
dog did not like being shut up when the children
went off to have a good time.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Patter! Please be quiet,” begged
Bunny.</p>

<p>But the more the boy talked the more excitedly
the dog barked.</p>

<p>“What makes him so noisy?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Bunny.</p>

<p>“Do you think he smells that Frenchman
who might be sneaking around to get our dog
away?” asked the little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe so,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked Patter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>He stopped racing about and stood for a
moment at the side of the pony, while Bunny
and Sue sat in the cart. Suddenly the trick
dog made a spring, and leaped into the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! Look!” cried Sue. “What’s he
going to do?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A RUNAWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> knowing what trick it was, if such it
should prove to be, that Patter planned to do
next, Bunny could not answer his sister’s question.
And then, as both children looked at
the trick dog, Patter suddenly jumped to the
broad, fat back of Toby, who was still hitched
to the pony cart. Right on the pony’s back
jumped the dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at that!” cried Sue again.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine trick!” said Bunny. “We
must make him do that in the show we’re going
to give. But I wonder why he did it?
I didn’t tell him to.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, either,” said Sue. “Oh, how cute
he looks!”</p>

<p>And indeed Patter did look “cute” on
Toby’s back. But this was not all the trick.
For suddenly the dog, instead of standing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
all four feet, gave a sort of flop and there he
was, standing on his front feet with his hind
paws up in the air.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue were so surprised they
hardly knew what to say. They just stood
there, looking at Patter standing on his front
paws upon the back of Toby, the Shetland
pony.</p>

<p>As for Toby, he did not in the least seem to
mind it. He turned his head a little way,
glanced at the dog on his back, and then
seemed to think it was all right, for he made
no move toward shaking Patter off.</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you s’pose he did that?” asked
Sue.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Bunny. “He just
did it—that’s all.”</p>

<p>And that, really, was all there was to it.
Patter had watched his chance and had leaped
to the pony’s back. The trick dog did not
long stand on his front paws. That is hard for
any dog to do, and the best of them cannot
keep it up for much more than a minute.
Standing on the hind paws is easier.</p>

<p>“That’s the very trick you said you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
going to teach Patter to do, isn’t it, Bunny?”
asked Sue of her brother.</p>

<p>“It is,” he answered. “But I didn’t have
time to teach him. I guess he taught himself.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to call mother out to see,” said
Sue. But before Mrs. Brown could reach the
yard, where Patter had shown off his latest
trick, the dog had become tired of standing
on his front legs and had sat down on Toby’s
back.</p>

<p>The children told Mrs. Brown all that had
happened.</p>

<p>“What do you s’pose made him do it?”
Bunny wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I think,” answered his mother, “that Patter
was taught the trick by his French master.
This is the first time the dog had to show us
that he could do it, and he jumped up as soon
as Toby stood still.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t jump up on Toby’s back when
he first saw our pony,” remarked Sue.</p>

<p>“No, I suppose Patter wanted to see what
Toby was like before he tried the trick,” suggested
Mrs. Brown. “But now you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
your pony and your new dog are good
friends.”</p>

<p>“Just as good as Splash and Toby were,”
said Sue.</p>

<p>“I wish we had Splash back,” sighed
Bunny. “Then we’d have two dogs and a
pony.”</p>

<p>“I think one dog and a pony is quite
enough,” laughed his mother.</p>

<p>“But if we had Splash we could have a lot
better circus,” went on Bunny.</p>

<p>“Are you going to give another circus?”
asked his mother, for the children once did
that, as I have related to you in one of these
books.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re going to have another circus
and Patter and Toby will do tricks,” decided
Bunny, while Sue nodded her head to show
that she agreed with this.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if Patter will mind me now,” said
Bunny. He called: “Come down, Patter!”</p>

<p>Down jumped the trick dog off Toby’s
back. He wagged his tail, did Patter, and
looked up into Bunny’s face as if asking what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
other tricks the little master wanted performed.</p>

<p>“See if he’ll jump back again,” suggested
Mrs. Brown. “If he does, you’ll know it is
one of Patter’s regular tricks to get on a pony’s
back. You’ll know it wasn’t just an accident.”</p>

<p>So Bunny patted his pony’s back and called:</p>

<p>“Jump up, Patter! Jump up!”</p>

<p>In a second up jumped Patter again, sitting
calmly on Toby’s back and looking from Sue
to Bunny as if asking:</p>

<p>“Is there anything more you want me to
do?”</p>

<p>This time the dog did not stand on his front
legs. Perhaps he thought he had done enough
of that hard trick.</p>

<p>“Down!” cried Bunny, and the trick dog
leaped down.</p>

<p>“He’s a good minder,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, he minds very well,” agreed Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>The news that Bunny Brown and his sister
Sue had a new trick dog soon spread all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
through the neighborhood, and many boy and
girl chums of the brother and sister called to
see Patter. They also wanted to see Toby
when Sue explained that the pony had a lot
of new hair in place of the old that had fallen
out in his sickness.</p>

<p>The other boys and girls were allowed to
make Patter do some of his tricks, and two
of the boys, George Watson and Charlie Star,
told of tricks they had seen a dog do in a
circus.</p>

<p>“We’ll teach Patter them,” decided Bunny.</p>

<p>One of these tricks was to take a piece of
wood in his mouth, the wood being fastened
to a string and the string to a bell that was
hung on the fence. When Patter thus pulled
the stick he made the bell ring.</p>

<p>“We’ll make believe that’s the school bell
and that Patter rings it to show us school is to
start,” suggested Charlie.</p>

<p>“That will be a good trick for the show,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>It seemed to be all settled that Patter would
take part in a show and be the main actor,
though nothing was yet settled about where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the show would be held or what would be
done with the money that was taken in—if any
was.</p>

<p>“But we have all summer,” said Bunny, for
this was only the beginning of the summer
vacation.</p>

<p>Another trick that George Watson wanted
Patter to do was to climb a ladder, stand on a
little platform at the top, and jump off into
a blanket held by four boys, one at each
corner.</p>

<p>They tried their trick first by putting Patter
up on the fence, pretending it was a ladder,
and then Bunny called to the dog to jump off.
Patter did it all right, landing in the blanket
and so not getting hurt in the least.</p>

<p>But when they put the dog on top of the
woodshed, George explaining that the ladder
would be higher than this, then Patter seemed
to be afraid. He cried, crouched down, and
would not jump off.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Then he isn’t going to jump!” decided
Bunny. “Lift him down off the shed. I’m
not going to have my dog afraid!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>And the boys, being kind-hearted, did not
make Patter jump from the roof of the high
woodshed. The dog did not mind leaping
from the fence, but the shed was too high for
him, it seemed.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll get used to it after a bit,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, he does a lot of dandy tricks, and
we sure can have him in a show,” decided
Charlie.</p>

<p>“We’ll have Toby in, too,” said Sue. The
boys liked Sue and let her play with them as
often as she wished. And as she and Bunny
were nearly always together, the chums of one
were the chums of the other.</p>

<p>One day when Bunny and Sue were playing
with their dog in the yard their mother
called to them, saying:</p>

<p>“I wish you children would go to the store
for me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“And we’ll take Patter,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>The store was so near at hand that it was
not worth while to harness Toby to the pony
cart. And so, hand in hand, with Patter running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
along, now in front and now behind
them, Bunny and Sue went to the grocery
store.</p>

<p>“Hello, children!” called Mr. Gordon, who
kept the store. “What will it be to-day?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon always asked the children that.</p>

<p>“Three pounds of granulated sugar,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“And a bag of salt,” added Sue.</p>

<p>Often when the two children went to the
store together they each remembered half of
the things they were to get. To-day there
were just two things—sugar and salt—and
Bunny remembered one while Sue did not forget
the other.</p>

<p>“Sugar and salt, is it?” laughed Mr. Gordon.
“Well, don’t get them mixed, that’s all
I have to say.” He went to get the articles
and noticed, sitting in front of the counter,
Patter, the trick dog.</p>

<p>“That dog yours?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Bunny.</p>

<p>“Hum,” remarked Mr. Gordon, in such an
odd voice that Bunny inquired:</p>

<p>“Did you think he wasn’t ours?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“My daddy got him from a Frenchman,”
added Sue.</p>

<p>“The reason I asked,” said Mr. Gordon,
“was that a colored man was in here the other
day, asking me if I’d seen a dog like that. It
was just such a dog and just such a color, the
darkey said.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t his dog!” cried Sue. “This is
our dog. Daddy got him from a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not saying he didn’t,” Mr. Gordon
made haste to say. “But he’s like the colored
man’s dog.”</p>

<p>“Could the colored man’s dog do tricks?”
Bunny wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure about that. The man didn’t
say.”</p>

<p>“Well, our dog does tricks,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Can he sneeze and roll over for a cookie?”
asked Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>“Is that a trick?” Bunny wanted to know.</p>

<p>“It’s a good trick!” declared the store man.
“Here, I’ll try and see if your dog can do it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon took a sweet cracker from a
box and raised it up so Patter could see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The dog held his head on one side and pricked
up his ears.</p>

<p>“Roll over and sneeze! Roll over and
sneeze!” called Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>And, to the surprise of the children, their
dog did just that. He made a noise that
sounded like an old man sneezing, and then
he rolled over.</p>

<p>“Oh, how cute!” cried Sue, as Mr. Gordon
gave Patter the cracker.</p>

<p>“That’s another trick for the show!” said
Bunny, with a laugh. “Let me try to make
him do it again, please, Mr. Gordon.”</p>

<p>“All right,” chuckled the grocer. This
time he took out three crackers. “Here’s one
for you, Bunny, one for Sue, and one for the
dog,” he said, for Patter had quickly eaten the
first cracker and was looking for more.</p>

<p>“Sneeze and roll over, Patter!” cried
Bunny, snapping his finger on his thumb. He
also held out the cracker where the dog could
see it. Patter looked at it, cocked his head
on one side and then he sneezed and rolled
over.</p>

<p>“Oh, he did it for me! He did it for me!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
cried Bunny in delight, as he gave the dog the
second cracker.</p>

<p>“I guess he knows more tricks than you
think,” said Mr. Gordon, while Bunny and
Sue ate their crackers.</p>

<p>“He’s the best dog we ever had!” declared
Bunny. “Though of course we loved Splash.
But we haven’t got him now.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see, what was it you wanted, vinegar
and molasses?” asked the grocer.</p>

<p>“No, sugar and salt,” answered Sue.</p>

<p>“I knew it was something like vinegar, anyhow,”
chuckled the grocer, as he wrapped up
the packages.</p>

<p>Sue and Bunny hurried home to tell the
news about the “sneeze-and-roll-over” trick
their dog could do. They were so excited
that Sue dropped the bag of salt, which burst
and a lot spilled out.</p>

<p>“But, anyhow, it was better the salt should
spill than the sugar,” said Mary, the maid.
“Salt’s cheaper ’n sugar.”</p>

<p>The summer days passed, with Bunny and
Sue having much fun with Patter, teaching
him new tricks now and then. Bunny and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the boys often talked about the show they were
going to have with Patter and Toby, but, as
yet, they had done nothing about it.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Brown sent Bunny and Sue
in the pony cart down to their father’s dock.
Of course Patter went along, for he knew his
way about the town very well now, and would
not get lost.</p>

<p>On their way home, when about half way
back from their father’s dock, a big automobile
truck came suddenly out of a side street,
making such a noise that Toby, the usually
gentle and quiet pony, jumped in fright and
then started to gallop as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“Oh, Toby’s running away! He’s running
away!” cried Sue, clinging to the side of the
cart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunny</span> did not have a very tight hold of
the reins when he was driving Toby, for generally
the pony was so gentle that he needed
but little guiding. And when the little horse
gave a jump and started to run, after being
frightened by the auto truck, the reins, or the
“lines” as Sue sometimes called them, slipped
over the dashboard and dangled around
Toby’s heels.</p>

<p>“Stop him, Bunny! Stop Toby from running
away!” begged Sue.</p>

<p>For a moment her brother did not answer.
He was as surprised as Sue at Toby’s strange
action. Then, as Bunny saw that the reins
had slipped away, he cried:</p>

<p>“I can’t stop him, Sue!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked, still holding to the
side of the pony cart as it lurched from side
to side of the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“I can’t stop him ’cause I can’t pull on the
reins,” Bunny answered. “I can’t reach
’em!”</p>

<p>“You—you’ve <i>got</i> to!” insisted Sue. “We
don’t want to be runned away with and thrown
out! Stop him, Bunny!”</p>

<p>Bunny knew that he would have to do something,
and the best thing he could think of was
to reach forward and grasp the reins. He
started to do this, leaning over the dashboard.</p>

<p>But just then a strange dog ran out of a
yard and began barking at Toby. Patter, who
was running alongside the cart, not riding in
it this time, barked and growled at the strange
dog. This sound seemed to make the little
horse go faster, and he dashed off so suddenly
that, as Bunny leaned toward the dashboard,
the little fellow almost went “overboard,” as
he said later.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Sue, as she saw what had happened.
“Look out!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Bunny Brown. He, too, was
frightened. He managed to get back again to
the seat from which he had risen, and there he
sat, safe for a little while, at least. And so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
was Sue. She was on the seat across from
Bunny.</p>

<p>“I—I’m not going to do that again!” gasped
the boy. “I can’t reach those reins and I’m
not going to try. They’re too far away.”</p>

<p>“But what—what are we going to do?” faltered
Sue, almost ready to cry. “He’s runnin’
away, isn’t he, Bunny?”</p>

<p>She seemed not quite sure about it.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s running away all right,” admitted
Bunny. “He hasn’t done that for a
long time, though. But he’s running away
now.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he feels so good now, ’cause his
hair doesn’t fall out any more, that he wants
to run,” went on Sue.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>“But we have to stop him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have to stop him.”</p>

<p>Bunny agreed on this point, but how it was
going to be done was another matter. Toby
seemed to be going faster now. He was running
away in earnest, and the reins, dangling
around his hind feet, did not make him feel
any better. In fact they scared him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The street was a quiet one, and up to now
Bunny and Sue had met no other wagons,
carriages or automobiles. And there were no
persons in the street to run out and stop Toby,
which might easily have been done, for the
Shetland pony was not much bigger than a
large Newfoundland dog.</p>

<p>As for Patter, he trotted alongside the runaway
and seemed to think it was all in fun.
Now and then he looked up at Bunny and Sue
and barked, as much as to say:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take me up there in the cart
with you and give me a nice ride?”</p>

<p>But Bunny and Sue thought of nothing like
this. Finally, as the small pony seemed to be
running away faster, Sue exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I don’t care, Bunny Brown! I’m going to
jump out! I’m not going to be runned away
with and all mashed up against a tree! I’m
going to jump out!”</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that!” begged her brother.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to if you don’t stop Toby.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stop Toby! I can’t reach the
reins!” replied Bunny. “But maybe Patter
can stop him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“How?”</p>

<p>“Patter can grab hold of the reins and pull
back. And when Toby feels the reins being
pulled back he’ll stop,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, try it! Try it!” entreated Sue.</p>

<p>Now this was a trick that Patter had never
been asked to do. It was not really a trick at
all. In fact it was more useful than doing
some of the tricks Patter could perform. For
if Patter could stop Toby from running away
he might save Bunny and Sue from being
hurt. At any rate Bunny was going to try.</p>

<p>Leaning over the side of the cart, Bunny
called to the trick dog:</p>

<p>“Stop him, Patter! Take hold of the reins
and stop Toby from running away!”</p>

<p>Bunny snapped his fingers and pointed to
Toby’s back. Perhaps he should have pointed
to the trailing reins, but he did not. And
Patter, pricking up his ears and looking at
Bunny’s outstretched hand pointing to the
pony, had but one thought in mind. This was
to do the trick he had done before—that of
jumping on Toby’s back.</p>

<p>And, in another instant, Patter leaped up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
landed on the pony’s back and sat there. He
did not try the trick of standing on his front
legs as he had done before.</p>

<p>“Oh, look what he did!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bunny. “I didn’t mean for him
to do that. I wanted him to grab the lines
from the ground.”</p>

<p>“Well, he can do it just as well from Toby’s
back,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, so he can!” exclaimed Bunny. “Grab
the lines, Patter! Grab the lines!” cried the
little boy.</p>

<p>Whether Patter, crouched on the pony’s
broad, fat back, understood these words or not,
he saw the gesture and he reached forward
and caught hold of the reins in his teeth, near
the place where they ran through two shiny
rings on the middle part of the harness.</p>

<p>Patter leaned back and pulled as hard as
he could. And as soon as Toby felt himself
being pulled in, he did just what he always
did when that happened. He slowed down.
I think he had had enough of running away
and thought it time to stop. And probably
he thought it was Bunny pulling on the reins.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
But it wasn’t. It was Patter, the trick dog.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Toby slowed down to a walk, and
then, as Patter kept on pulling the reins, the
pony stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh, the runaway is over!” sighed Sue.
“I’m so glad!”</p>

<p>“And we didn’t get hurt,” added Bunny
Brown.</p>

<p>Just then around the corner of a street near
which Toby had stopped, came Bunker Blue.
The boy from Mr. Brown’s boat and fish dock
had been on an errand. Seeing the two children,
with Patter up on Toby’s back, Bunker
Blue said:</p>

<p>“You two oughtn’t to be playing tricks like
that out in the street here. It’s all right to
make Patter do tricks, but not in the street.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t making him play tricks,” answered
Bunny. “Toby ran away and Patter
stopped him.”</p>

<p>And when he and Sue had told how it happened,
Bunker said:</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right! That was fine. But
I’ll drive Toby back home for you, as he might
get frisky again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>But the little horse did not, trotting along
very quietly. And when Bunny and Sue
reached home, and Mrs. Brown heard what
had happened, she remarked:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it won’t be safe for you children
to go out with Toby alone any more. He is
too frisky.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it will wear off,” said Bunker
Blue. “You see, he hasn’t had much exercise
since he came back from the farm. He’ll be
all right.”</p>

<p>And Toby was, for he did not again run
away—at least not for a long time. Daddy
Brown said Patter was a very smart dog to
stop a runaway as he did. They were talking
about it after supper, and then Mrs. Brown
asked:</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything more about the
poor man in the hospital?”</p>

<p>“No, except that he says his name is Jason
Stern, and he says he has no friends left to help
him unless he can find Jim Denton, the circus
owner,” replied Mr. Brown. “But no one
seems to know where Jim Denton is, and Mr.
Stern is too ill to tell the hospital folks very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
much. I think the old man came to the
wrong town. He must mean some other
Bellemere; there are a lot of them in this country.
Well, I’ll go to see him again soon when
he gets a little better.”</p>

<p>Bunny Brown and his sister Sue continued
to have a lot of fun with the trick dog and
their pony. One day some of his boy chums
came over to see Bunny.</p>

<p>“Say,” asked Charlie Star, “when are we
going to have that show you were talking of,
Bunny?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added Harry Bentley. “We
want to get up a show with your trick dog and
your pony. We can get some other animals,
too.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Bunny. “Let’s go out
to our barn now and talk about it. If we have
the show it will be in our barn.”</p>

<p>To this the other boys agreed, and they
strolled out to the barn where in times past
they had had many good times.</p>

<p>Near the barn was a little brook of water,
and Bunny and the boys began throwing stones
in this to hear the splashes. As Bunny threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
his second stone his cap dropped off and the
wind carried it into the brook. It fell in the
middle of the stream.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Bunny threw his cap in!” cried
Charlie.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t throw it!” said Bunny.</p>

<p>But no sooner had Patter seen the cap in
the water than in he plunged and began swimming
toward it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>IN THE BARN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Look!</span> Oh, look at your dog, Bunny!”
cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“He’s a regular cap dog! He’s going to
bring your cap to shore!” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine trick!” said Bunny with delight,
as he watched Patter swim out to the
middle of the brook, and then, having taken
the cap in his teeth, swim back to shore with
it. “That’s as good a trick as standing on his
front legs on Toby’s back.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t any trick!” called another voice,
and George Watson came through the bushes
just as Patter laid the cap, dripping wet, at
Bunny’s feet.</p>

<p>“What isn’t a trick?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Bringing that cap to shore,” said George.</p>

<p>“Aw, ’tis so a trick!” cried Harry. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
haven’t got any dog that’ll do such a trick,
George Watson.”</p>

<p>“I know I haven’t. I haven’t any dog at
all. But that isn’t a trick, just the same. I
don’t mean to say your dog isn’t a good one,
Bunny,” went on George, who was a little
older than the other boys; “but that isn’t any
more of a trick than bringing a stick to shore
is a trick. Any dog will jump in the water
and bring a stick to shore.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he will,” admitted Bunny.
“But not every dog would bring a cap to shore
like Patter did for me.”</p>

<p>“He thought your cap was a stick,” said
George, who seemed to like to have a little dispute
with his chums. “He’d bring anything
to shore that you threw into the water. Here,
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>George picked up a stick and threw it out
into the middle of the brook. Patter did not
go in after it. The dog, after having shaken
himself to get rid of the water on his shaggy
coat, simply looked at the stick floating in the
stream.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! Will he go in and get a stick? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
guess not!” cried Bunny. “Sure, he’s a trick
dog! He’s a <i>cap</i> dog but not a <i>stick</i> dog!”</p>

<p>“That’s ’cause you didn’t tell him to go in
after it,” said George. “If you tell him to
go get the stick he will. He won’t mind me,
that’s all,” for George had told Patter to get
the stick when it was first thrown in, but the
dog would not. “Lots of dogs won’t mind any
but the fellow that owns them,” explained
George. “Course that makes ’em all the better
dog. But if you tell Patter to bring out
my stick, Bunny, he’ll do it same as he would
your cap.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll tell him,” said Sue’s brother.
The stick was slowly floating down stream.</p>

<p>“Go get it, Patter! Go get it!” ordered
Bunny, snapping his fingers and pointing, as
he did whenever he wanted the dog to do any
of his tricks, such as leaping on Toby’s back
or walking on his hind legs.</p>

<p>But Patter, though he wagged his tail to
show he was friendly, would not make a move
toward leaping into the brook after the stick.
He simply sat on the bank and looked at it.</p>

<p>“Go get it, Patter!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Still Patter would not move.</p>

<p>“Go on! Good dog! Get the stick!” cried
George. The other boys added their voices to
the orders, but, Bunny declared, Patter just
simply seemed to smile as though he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be mean, but I don’t know
what you are talking about. Sticks mean
nothing to me.”</p>

<p>Finally, after Bunny had thrown another
stick in the stream, at George’s suggestion,
thinking perhaps Patter would not bring out a
stick that another lad had tossed in, the boys
began to get the opinion that Patter was a
queer dog.</p>

<p>“He’ll bring out a <i>cap</i> but he won’t bring
out <i>sticks</i>,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“He’s a cap dog, I say!” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“Maybe he won’t bring out the cap again,”
George suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll try him,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>Once more he tossed his cap into the water—purposely
this time. In an instant Patter
jumped in and brought it to shore, and he
paid no attention to sticks that were floating
in the brook near it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Let’s all throw our caps in!” cried Charlie.
“If he only pulls caps out we’ll let him do
that.”</p>

<p>“One at a time! One at a time!” exclaimed
Bunny. “We don’t want to give him too
much to do.”</p>

<p>And when one boy’s cap after another was
tossed into the brook, Patter brought them
safe to shore. The boys wore old caps and a
little water, more or less, did them no harm.
Patter seem delighted to swim out and get
them.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s true, what you said, Harry,”
remarked George. “He’s a cap dog all right.
But I never heard of a dog that would bring
out caps but not sticks. I never did.”</p>

<p>Still it was true. Later Bunny learned that
the dog’s master, the Frenchman who had
taught Patter a number of tricks, had taught
him never to bother with sticks, but always to
bring out caps or hats. It was quite an odd
thing, the boys thought, and Bunny was more
proud than ever of Patter.</p>

<p>For some time the boys amused themselves,
and gave fun to Patter by throwing their caps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
into the water and watching him bring them
out. Patter seemed to enjoy it as much as the
boys did.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go on to the barn and talk more
about the show,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p>“What show is that? Can I come?” asked
George, who had not heard the remarks about
the proposed performance.</p>

<p>“Bunny’s going to give a show, as he did
before, with his new trick dog and his pony,”
explained Charlie.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring my pet alligator,” offered
George.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you got an alligator?” cried the
other boys.</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p>“My uncle sent him to me from Florida.
He’s two feet long and he eats raw
meat.”</p>

<p>“Who does—your uncle?” asked Charlie,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No, my alligator!” and George also
chuckled. “But are you really going to give
a show, Bunny?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“I guess so,” answered the owner of Patter.</p>

<p>“Like you did before?” George wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Once before, as told of in the book of that
name, Bunny Brown and his Sister Sue had
given a show. It was really gotten up by the
ladies of the town in aid of the Red Cross, but
Bunny and Sue and some other boys and girls
helped. Toby, the pony, was in the show, and
so was Splash, the dog, who had been sent
away to be cured of a disease, but who had
never come back. Bunny and Sue feared
Splash was dead, and their father and mother
said little about the old dog for fear of making
the children feel sad. Then, too, in the show
was Jed Winkler’s monkey named Wango.
You’ll hear more about that monkey later on
in this book.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’ll be fun to have another show,”
decided George, when told that he could be in
it with his alligator.</p>

<p>“And we’ll make Patter do a lot of tricks
with Toby,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know how we can have a dandy act
in the show!” exclaimed Bunny, as he and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
other boys sat about the Brown barn talking
matters over.</p>

<p>“How?” asked his chums.</p>

<p>“With the hat and stick trick,” went on
Bunny. “One of you boys can dress up like a
clown, and we’ll have a tank of water in the
show.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean for one of us to push the
clown into the tank of water?” asked George.</p>

<p>“That’ll be fun!” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean that,” said Bunny. “Listen!
We’ll put a tank of water in the show,
which we can have here in our barn, I guess.
Then the clown, who’ll be one of you boys,
can come out and throw a stick into the tank
of water. He’ll want Patter to go in and
bring out the stick, but Patter won’t, just as he
wouldn’t to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the trick in that?” George
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Wait,” went on Bunny. “I’ll come along
dressed up like a tramp, and when I see that
Patter won’t bring out the stick for the clown,
I’ll laugh and say I can make him bring it
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“But he wouldn’t bring out the stick for
you to-day,” objected George.</p>

<p>“No, but I can make him,” said Bunny.
“While I’m dressed up like a tramp, and
while one of you is a clown, we’ll have a make-believe
quarrel about who can make the dog
bring out a stick. Then when the clown
can’t, I’ll take a stick, put it inside my cap and
throw the cap into the tank, and Patter will
bring out my cap and the stick too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, that’s a good trick!”</p>

<p>“It’s a dandy!”</p>

<p>“It’s the best trick we ever had in a
show!”</p>

<p>The three boys, in turn, cried these opinions
to Bunny Brown, and Bunny felt rather proud
of having thought of such a funny bit of work
all by himself.</p>

<p>“Let’s try it now and see if it works,” suggested
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Only we don’t have to dress up,” said
George.</p>

<p>The boys ran out to the brook again, and
once more tossed in sticks. As before, Patter
would not bring them out. Then Bunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
tossed his cap in, and the dog brought that
out.</p>

<p>Next Bunny wrapped a stick in his cap, and
threw both into the brook. Patter brought
them both out.</p>

<p>“See! He’ll do it!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>So they fixed on that as one of the “acts” in
the show they were going to get up. Then
they wandered around the barn planning
other acts and tricks.</p>

<p>Suddenly Charlie, who had climbed up to
the haymow, gave a cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, look what I found!” he shouted.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>WHERE IS SUE?</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> is it, a hen’s nest?”</p>

<p>“Are there any eggs in it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a groundhog!”</p>

<p>In turn George, Harry and Bunny shouted
these words at Charlie Star when they heard
him call from the old haymow that he had
found something.</p>

<p>“If there’s eggs in the nest don’t break ’em!”
called Bunny. “But maybe it’s a groundhog,”
he added.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t eggs and it isn’t a groundhog,”
said Charlie. It might easily have been
either one, since the hens often laid eggs in
the hay, and groundhogs, or woodchucks,
were plentiful in the fields about the Brown
home. Though the boys did not see them
very often, for woodchucks are shy.</p>

<p>The Brown barn was not used now as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
for a stable as it had been in years past. Mr.
Brown formerly kept a number of horses to
help in the boat and fish business. But when
automobiles became common he sold his
horses and bought autos. He kept one horse,
however, to haul the fishing boats up the beach
out of the water and away from the rising tide,
and this horse was kept in the barn, as was
Toby.</p>

<p>When you keep a horse you have to feed
him on hay and that is why there was a mow,
or place for storing hay, for the horse. There
were also oat-bins and places for other fodder,
though these were not as full as when a
number of horses were kept.</p>

<p>“What’ve you found, Charlie?” asked
Bunny, as the other boys climbed up to the
haymow, which was reached by a short ladder
from the main floor of the barn. “Where
is it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve found a dandy trapeze,” answered the
boy. “Look, it’s got ropes and a cross piece
and everything! And it’s fastened up to the
roof beam with iron rings, just like a regular
circus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Say, that’s a dandy!” cried George.</p>

<p>“One of the best I ever saw!” was Harry’s
opinion.</p>

<p>“Did you put it up, Bunny?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t even know it was there.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Bunker Blue did,” suggested
George.</p>

<p>Bunny did not think this likely, for if
Bunker had done anything of the sort he
would have told Bunny and would have
wanted Bunny to see him perform on the
swinging trapeze.</p>

<p>“I guess maybe it was put up before we
came here,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>But later, on asking his father about it,
Bunny learned that the trapeze had been put
in place by a hired man who used to work
for Mr. Brown. It was some years before
and the trapeze had been forgotten.</p>

<p>It was in a space back of a pile of hay, and
not easily seen unless one climbed in the far
end of the mow, as Charlie had done. The
boys clustered around the swinging ropes to
the ends of which a cross piece of wood was
fastened, making the trapeze bar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Let me try a swing on it,” begged Bunny.
The other boys were moving away to give him
“first whack,” for it was in Bunny’s barn,
when Charlie cried:</p>

<p>“Better let George swing on it first. He’s
heaviest and if it holds him it will hold any
of us.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid!” boasted George.</p>

<p>“Better pull some hay under it so if the
ropes break you won’t get hurt,” suggested
Bunny. “My father wouldn’t like it if any of
you boys got hurt in our barn.”</p>

<p>“I guess we wouldn’t like it ourselves if we
got hurt!” laughed George.</p>

<p>He could just reach the trapeze bar by
jumping up with outstretched hands, and,
once having hold of it, he boldly swung to and
fro. The ropes did not break and George
did not fall, somewhat to the disappointment
of the other lads, who rather hoped something
like this would happen.</p>

<p>But, as Bunny said:</p>

<p>“If he had fallen it wouldn’t ’a’ hurt him.”</p>

<p>And, to speak the truth, it would not. The
hay would have made a soft cushion. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
to make sure it was safe, George and Charlie
hung on the trapeze together. The ropes
held and then it was decided it would be safe
for any of them to perform on it.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to start, however,
there was a whining, crying sound in the main
part of the barn.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried George.</p>

<p>They all listened.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s Patter,” said Bunny. “We left
him down below when we climbed up the
ladder to come here. I’ll get him.”</p>

<p>Leaving the other boys to play on the
trapeze, Bunny went back to the top of the
ladder that led up to the haymow. Below
on the floor in the main part of the barn, was
poor Patter, whining and crying and whimpering
because he was lonesome. He had
waited some time, hoping the boys would
come back to him, but when they did not he
called to them in the only way dogs can talk.</p>

<p>“Poor Patter!” said Bunny kindly. “Do
you want to come with us?”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked Patter, and he whined
and whimpered again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>At first Bunny was going down the ladder
to get his dog. But he happened to think
that he could hardly climb up the ladder
again and carry Patter with him. Then
Bunny had another idea.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you climb the ladder, Patter?”
he asked his dog.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” again barked the trick dog.
This might mean that he could or couldn’t,
whichever way you took it. But Bunny
seemed to think it meant that Patter could
climb up the ladder to the haymow, for
Bunny held his hands down invitingly and
called:</p>

<p>“Come on up, Patter! come on up!”</p>

<p>Again Patter whined and cried, and then,
as Bunny called again, the wise dog put his
two front paws on the first round of the ladder
and then pulled himself up so that he could
reach the second round from the floor with his
front paws, and get his hind paws on the first
round.</p>

<p>“Oh, good, Patter! That’s great!” shouted
Bunny. “You are learning another trick!”</p>

<p>The ladder was built straight up against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the side of the haymow, and did not slant out
like the ladder the painter uses.</p>

<p>Calling to his dog, and snapping his fingers,
Bunny urged Patter to make his way
slowly up the ladder. And then, with a joyful
bark, the dog flung himself from the top
of the ladder to the pile of hay where Bunny
was waiting and tried to lick his little master’s
face.</p>

<p>From where the other boys were playing on
the trapeze came a hail:</p>

<p>“Where are you, Bunny? Come on, take a
swing!”</p>

<p>“I skinned the cat on it!” boasted George.</p>

<p>This did not mean just what it seems to.
George did not really skin a cat. But he
turned himself through his arms as he hung
by his hands on the trapeze bar. This is
called “skinning the cat,” and I have no doubt
you boys have often done it.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bunny!” cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there in a minute!” Bunny said,
“But you ought to see what Patter did just
now!”</p>

<p>“Did he find a hen’s nest and roll in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
eggs?” asked Harry. Once Bunny’s other
dog, Splash, had done this, and when he came
out he looked “just like an omelet,” Bunker
Blue had said.</p>

<p>“No, Patter didn’t roll in any eggs,”
laughed Bunny. “But he climbed up the haymow
ladder to me.”</p>

<p>“No! Did he really?” cried the boys.</p>

<p>“Come and see!” invited Bunny.</p>

<p>Leaving the trapeze, the other boys hurried
over the hay to Bunny, where the little
boy sat on the pile of dried fodder with
Patter.</p>

<p>“Let’s see him do it!” called George.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to put him down on the floor
again,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>He climbed down the ladder and then
called to Patter. It was too much to expect
the dog to go down the ladder as he had
climbed up, so Bunny made a pile of hay on
the floor near where he stood.</p>

<p>“Come on, Patter! Come on down!”
called Bunny.</p>

<p>The dog whined a little, looked about as if
to find another way to join his beloved young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
master, and then leaped down to the pile of
hay. Of course he wasn’t hurt.</p>

<p>“You stay there and I’ll call him to climb
up here again,” suggested Charlie.</p>

<p>But Patter would not climb the ladder on
the invitation of any of the other boys. He
remained at Bunny’s side.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to come up and call him,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“I guess I will,” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>He started up the ladder, and Patter
whined to see him go. But Bunny called
back:</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be up with me, Patter!”</p>

<p>When Bunny reached the top of the ladder
and stepped off on to the hay he leaned down
and called to Patter to climb up as he had
done at first.</p>

<p>Patter whined a little, but bravely started
up, putting first one paw then another on the
cross-pieces of the ladder. In a few minutes
he was once more beside Bunny on the
hay.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a fine dog!” cried Bunny, and
he hugged his pet, while the other boys patted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
him. Patter wagged his tail and seemed very
glad.</p>

<p>“That’s a good trick—that ladder one,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll have Patter do that in the show,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he just learned it, or whether
that Frenchman taught him?” said George.</p>

<p>As none of the boys could tell, they guessed
at it, some of them saying Bunny had really
taught Patter the trick, and the others thinking
the Frenchman must have taught the trick
to the dog.</p>

<p>“He does it terribly naturally,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“It’s a good trick, all right,” declared
George. “And it will work in with another
I’ve just thought of. I know a dandy one we
can have Patter do in the show.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“It’s to have your dog swing on the trapeze!”
cried George. “We could make a little
trapeze for him, and have him get up on
it by a little ladder, same as he did to-day.
Then he can swing and the people will clap
like anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Dogs can’t swing on trapezes!” declared
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, they can, too! I’ve seen ’em in a theater!”
boasted George. “All you have to do
is to hang their front legs over like this,” and
he pointed to the place where Patter’s front
legs joined his body.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we could do it without hurting
him?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Sure you can!” declared George.</p>

<p>“And if you can’t do it that way I know another,”
said Charlie.</p>

<p>“How?” chorused the other boys.</p>

<p>“We can tie a piece of leather to the bar of
the trapeze and have Patter hold it in his
teeth,” said Charlie. “Dogs have got an awful
strong grip in their teeth. Patter can hold
on by his teeth to the trapeze.”</p>

<p>“Both ways are good. We’ll try both
ways,” decided Bunny.</p>

<p>While the boys were getting ready to put
the trick dog on the trapeze, a voice was heard
calling in the main part of the barn:</p>

<p>“Bunny! Bunny! Where are you?”</p>

<p>“It’s Sue,” said her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Where are you, Bunny?” went on Sue.
“Don’t you hide away from me now!” she
went on. “Mother said you were out here
and she said I could play with you. Where
are you?”</p>

<p>“Up in the haymow,” answered Bunny.
“You can climb up, Sue.”</p>

<p>When Sue saw her brother and the other
boys with the dog and the trapeze, she wanted
to know what it was all about, so they told her.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll be fun if Patter swings on a
trapeze in the show!” cried Sue, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>Then the boys tried different ways of having
Patter hang to and swing from the trapeze.
They were so busy at this that they forgot
about Bunny’s little sister. They did not
think of her again until a little later that afternoon
when Mrs. Brown came out to the barn
and called:</p>

<p>“Bunny, are you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I’m here,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Is Sue with you?”</p>

<p>Bunny and his chums looked around the
haymow. Sue was not in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“No’m, Mother, Sue isn’t here,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” said Mrs. Brown. “I sent
her out to play with you.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Mother. And she came. But
she isn’t here now,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Sue! Sue! Where are you?” called Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<p>Where could Sue be?</p>

<small>THE CHURCH FAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunny Brown</span> and his boy chums stopped
what they were doing toward making it possible
for Patter to swing on the trapeze. They
had found that the dog could not hang by his
paws, as they hung by their hands, and Bunny
had said:</p>

<p>“Let’s make a little platform, like a seat, on
the trapeze bar, and Patter can sit on that as
he sits on Toby’s back. Then we can swing
him and it will be as good as if he hung by
his legs.”</p>

<p>After a little talk the boys decided on this
and that is what they were doing when Mrs.
Brown came to the barn and asked about Sue.</p>

<p>“We’ll help find her,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“She must be around here somewhere,”
added George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“’Cause she was here only a little while
ago,” remarked Charlie.</p>

<p>The trapeze, with the seat for Patter partly
finished, was left hanging by its swaying
ropes, and the boys scattered through the barn
calling Sue’s name and looking for her. Mrs.
Brown also looked, and so did Patter.</p>

<p>But for all their looking and for all their
calling, Sue could not be found. They tossed
aside the hay, for once Sue had gone into the
barn to play with Bunny, and she had fallen
asleep. Some hay was scattered over her, and
it was a long time before she was found. Mrs.
Brown had been very anxious then and Bunny
was so frightened that he cried.</p>

<p>“So this time we must first make sure that
Sue isn’t under the hay,” said the little girl’s
mother.</p>

<p>The boys searched and tossed the hay this
way and that, even looking under the pile they
had put on the floor for Patter to jump upon.
But Sue was not there.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s in the oat bin,” suggested
Bunny.</p>

<p>Now, as there was only Toby, the pony, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
only one old horse, used to haul the boats up
on the beach, not many oats were needed, and
only a few were kept in the big bin that,
formerly, was filled. The bin made a good
hiding place and Bunny and Sue often used
it when playing games.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better look in the oat bin,”
agreed Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>The cover was raised, and the boys and
Sue’s mother peered into the big box, hoping
to see the little girl. But Sue was not there.</p>

<p>“Where can the child be?” exclaimed Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>“Maybe Patter can find her,” said George.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right!” chimed in the other
boys.</p>

<p>“Patter found the caps we threw into the
water,” said Charlie. “So he ought to find
Sue.”</p>

<p>“Go find her, Patter!” ordered Bunny,
snapping his fingers. “Go find Sue!”</p>

<p>Patter seemed to understand. He pricked
up his ears and cocked his head on one side.
Then, with a bark, he ran to different parts
of the barn, poking his nose into all sorts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
odd places. Bunny had taught him this trick,
which, in a way, was like playing hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>Once, when he was running around this
way, looking for little lost Sue, Patter stopped
near a hole and began barking loudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s found her! He’s found her!”
cried Bunny.</p>

<p>They all hurried to the place where Patter
was barking at the hole. Mrs. Brown, reaching
the spot first, said:</p>

<p>“Only a big rat!”</p>

<p>And, truly, a big brown rat ran out of the
hole and scurried across the barn floor.</p>

<p>“Sue can’t be in that hole!” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“It isn’t big enough,” added Charlie.</p>

<p>“And, anyhow, she’d be afraid of the rats,”
said George.</p>

<p>“My sister isn’t afraid of white rats,” declared
Bunny, “cause when we had our circus
she picked a white rat right up in her hands.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Nobody’s afraid of <i>white</i> rats!”
said Charlie.</p>

<p>“They is so! Aren’t some girls afraid of
white rats, Mother?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“I think so, yes, my dear. But don’t bother
about rats now. We must find Sue.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look under the hay again,” suggested
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Here’s a place where we didn’t look very
well,” said George, and he pointed to a heap
of hay near a small outside door of the barn,
close to the ground. Mr. Brown had had this
door made when he kept a cow, and it was
opened when he wanted to take hay out of
the barn for the cow, and did not want to open
the big doors. This door was open now,
swinging to and fro in the wind.</p>

<p>As this heap of hay had been forgotten and
not turned over in the other search, Mrs.
Brown thought perhaps Sue might be under
it, having fallen asleep, not hearing the calls
that were given.</p>

<p>Bunny and his chums tossed this hay aside
with their hands. They had not gone down
very far in it when, all of a sudden, something
moved under the pile of dried grass fodder.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s here! She’s here!” cried
Bunny.</p>

<p>But when a little more of the hay had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
pushed aside, instead of seeing Sue Brown,
her mother and the boys saw the queer, wizened
face of Mr. Winkler’s monkey, whose
name was Wango.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Sue at all!” gasped Bunny.</p>

<p>“Unless she’s turned into a monkey,” added
Harry, who was fond of reading fairy stories.</p>

<p>“She couldn’t turn into <i>this</i> monkey, ’cause
he’s Mr. Winkler’s Wango,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I’m afraid something has
really happened!” exclaimed Mrs. Brown.
“Sue, where are you?” She called this last
out loudly.</p>

<p>Then a voice outside the low, swinging door
of the barn answered and said:</p>

<p>“Here I am! Is Wango there? Were
you looking for me?”</p>

<p>“Were we looking for you, child? Well,
I should say we were!” exclaimed Mrs.
Brown. “Where in the world have you
been?”</p>

<p>“I went over to get Wango,” answered Sue.
“But he ran away from me,” and then, in
through the low door came Sue herself, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
dress torn and dirty and with streaks of mud
on her face. But she was safe and sound, and
when she saw Wango, who was sitting on the
pile of hay looking at the boys, Sue exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are, you bad monkey! You
ran away from me, didn’t you? And you tore
my dress and made me all muddy!”</p>

<p>“Yip! Yip! Yip!” chatted Wango, which
seemed to be his way of saying:</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p>“Sue, why did you run away?” asked her
mother. “We have been looking everywhere
for you!”</p>

<p>“Well, I came out here to play with the
boys, and they were making a trapeze for Patter
to do tricks on,” said Sue, and she looked
at her dog and the monkey, who had quickly
made friends. “Then I thought maybe it
would be nice if we could have Wango and
Patter on the same trapeze, so I went over to
get the monkey.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Winkler say you could take
him?” asked Mrs. Brown. Sometimes the old
sailor who owned Wango let the children play
with his pet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“No, he wasn’t at home, and I knew it
wouldn’t be any use to ask his sister,” went on
Sue. “She doesn’t like the monkey, anyhow.”</p>

<p>This was very true. Miss Euphemia Winkler,
sister of the old sailor, who kept house for
him, did not like Wango. She often said she
wished he would run away and never come
back.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you do?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, the monkey was sitting out on the
porch, chained to a post, so I unchained him
and started over here with him,” said Sue.
“But he pulled his collar loose and got away.
Then I chased after him and he ran across the
brook on the little plank bridge. I ran after
him, and I almost caught him, but he got
away and I fell down and I tore my dress and
I got muddy.”</p>

<p>“I see you did,” said Mrs. Brown. But she
knew children must play and get a bit dirty,
so she did not scold Sue for that.</p>

<p>“So I thought maybe Wango would run
over here, and he did,” went on Sue. “And
I came and here he is and that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Quite enough I should say!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Mrs. Brown. “Now, Sue, you must come in
and wash.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I stay and help the boys put Wango
and Patter on the trapeze?” begged Sue.</p>

<p>“Not until you have another dress on,” said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“It’ll take us quite a while to fix up the
platform, anyhow,” said George. “We’ll let
you see it when we get it fixed so Wango and
Patter swing on it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sue.</p>

<p>As Sue and her mother started from the
barn Mary, the maid, came out and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Brown, there are a lot of ladies
in the parlor waiting to see you. They’re
from the church.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! I forgot that they were coming,”
said Mrs. Brown. “They said they
would call to talk about the church fair.”</p>

<p>“What church fair, Mother?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“One we are getting up,” her mother answered.
“We are trying to raise money for
the poor, and we are going to have a fair and
entertainment in the opera house. I must go
in and talk to the ladies about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Oh, Mother, wait a minute!” called
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, little son? I am in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Mother, if you have a church fair we could
have Patter do tricks at it and that would
make a lot of money for you!” went on Bunny.
“Couldn’t we have the trick dog at the fair?”</p>

<p>“And the monkey, too?” added Sue.
“Don’t forget Wango!”</p>

<p>“Great!” cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea!” said George.</p>

<p>The boys shouted and hurrahed and Patter
barked while Wango chattered: “Yip! Yip!
Yip!” and there was great excitement for a
minute.</p>

<p>“We’ll talk a little later about the monkey
and the dog at the fair,” promised Mrs.
Brown. “Just now I must go in and see the
ladies.”</p>

<small>PATTER AND THE TICKETS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunny</span> and his boy chums were so excited
they hardly knew what to do. So many
things had happened.</p>

<p>There was the trick Patter did of bringing
the caps from the brook. Then came the
making of the trapeze, the finding of Sue and
the monkey, after Sue had been thought to be
lost, and lastly the idea of having the dog and
the monkey at the church fair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown went to the house with Sue,
to have Mary put a clean dress on the little
girl while Mrs. Brown went in to see the
ladies about the church fair. Bunny and the
boys kept on making the platform for the
swinging trapeze.</p>

<p>They tried several times before they could
get the board to stay on the crossbar of the
trapeze. But at last George managed to tie
it on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Now put Patter up on it and see if he’ll
stay there and swing,” suggested Charlie.</p>

<p>They made a pile of boxes near the trapeze,
and Bunny got his dog to get up on the
boxes. Then, pointing to the trapeze, Bunny
called:</p>

<p>“Jump up there, Patter.”</p>

<p>The dog jumped, but the board was smooth
and his toenails, not being sharp, like those of
a cat, just slid off, so that Patter fell down on
a pile of hay on the other side of the trapeze.
He did not hurt himself—in fact he thought
it was fun—but the trick was spoiled.</p>

<p>“Try it again,” said George, while Wango,
Mr. Winkler’s pet monkey, sat in the hay
chewing a stem of dried grass and looking
like a little old man who had come to see what
was going on.</p>

<p>Again Patter jumped, and again he slid
off the smooth board into the pile of hay.
And then Bunny had an idea.</p>

<p>“If we put a piece of carpet on the board
so it won’t be slippery, just as we put carpet
on our sleds, Patter won’t slide off,” said Sue’s
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“That’s a good idea!” cried Charlie.
“Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Bunny found a piece of carpet and the boys
fastened it with ropes to the board that was
tied to the trapeze bar. The next time Patter
jumped from the pile of boxes to the board he
did not slide off, but remained there, slowly
swinging to and fro and looking at the boys
as much as to say:</p>

<p>“Well, I did it all right that time. Why
didn’t you think of the carpet in the first
place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s doing the trick! He’s doing the
trick!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“He’s fine at it!” cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“The best dog I ever saw, even if he won’t
bring sticks from the brook,” admitted
George. “Now we’ll see if we can’t get
Wango to sit in the trapeze with Patter.”</p>

<p>The monkey knew and liked the boys, who
were kind to him, so he did not make a fuss
when they lifted him up beside Patter. Then
the monkey and dog swung to and fro on the
same carpet-covered trapeze board.</p>

<p>“The next thing to do is to teach Wango to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
jump up the way Patter does,” suggested
George. “We’ll do this next.”</p>

<p>So they began on that part of the trick
which Bunny and his chums hoped to produce
later in some sort of show, or circus.</p>

<p>“It would be great if we could have this
at the church fair,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p>“I guess it would make a lot of money for
’em,” said George.</p>

<p>“People would pay more to see tricks like
this than they would to hear a lot of girls
singing,” said Harry. “I hate girls’ singing,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“They sound like cats,” added Charlie.</p>

<p>It is a good thing Sue did not hear the boys
talking like this, or she might have said something
sharp. And I suppose she could have
pointed out things that the boys did which she
and the other girls did not like. She might
not have liked to hear them sing, though they
did not seem to think of this.</p>

<p>But Sue was not there and Bunny and his
chums kept on teaching Wango to leap from
the pile of boxes and sit beside Patter on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
trapeze. After a while the monkey did it
fairly well.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess this is enough for the first
day,” said Bunny, after a while. “If we
make Patter do tricks too much he’ll get
tired.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to take Wango back?”
asked Charlie. “Mr. Winkler will want
him, even if his sister doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take him,” offered George. “I’m going
that way.”</p>

<p>Wango was willing to be led along by
George, and the boy and the monkey, followed
by Harry and Charlie, went their ways,
while Bunny started for the house with
Patter.</p>

<p>As Bunny walked up the front steps Mrs.
Brown came out with the ladies. They had
been talking over the church fair, and had
made most of their plans.</p>

<p>“That’s our trick dog,” said Sue to the
ladies, as Bunny came along with Patter.
“He does lots of tricks.”</p>

<p>Just then one of the ladies dropped a basket
she was carrying. As quick as a flash Patter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
rushed forward, picked it up and then sat
up, holding the basket in his mouth, as if
he were waiting for something to be put into
it.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at Patter!” cried Sue. “Look!”</p>

<p>“That’s a new trick!” exclaimed Bunny.
“Oh, how many tricks our dog can do! But
this is a new one!”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>The ladies from the church looked at Patter
sitting up with the basket in his mouth.</p>

<p>“How very cute,” said one.</p>

<p>“And it gives me an idea,” said another.
“Bunny, how long do you think your dog
could sit up that way holding the basket?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he could sit up maybe an
hour,” the little boy answered.</p>

<p>“Not an hour at a time,” replied Mrs.
Brown. “But if he had a rest in between, he
might do it. He has been trained to sit up
that way,” she added. “But I never saw him
hold a basket before.”</p>

<p>“Why did you want to know how long he
could do that trick, Mrs. Jones?” inquired
another lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“I was thinking that we need something
new and novel at our church fair,” answered
Mrs. Jones. “Generally we have a man at
the door taking tickets. But if we could have
Bunny’s and Sue’s dog stand at the door, holding
a basket for the people to drop tickets in,
it would be something new and something
amusing.”</p>

<p>“And people would come to the fair to see
the dog taking tickets,” added Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>“That’s just my idea,” went on Mrs. Jones.
“It will be a sort of advertisement for us.
Bunny, do you think your dog would take
tickets at the door for our fair?”</p>

<p>“I guess he would,” Bunny answered.</p>

<p>“But he might want Bunny or me there by
his side to make him stay sitting up,” added
Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, I intended to have you two children,”
said Mrs. Jones, with a laugh. “You and
your dog will be the combined attraction.
Did any of you ladies ever hear of a dog taking
tickets in a basket at a church fair?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” answered Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Nor I,” added Mrs. Nelson, and the others
said the same thing.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll try it at our fair,” went on
Mrs. Jones. “I think Patter is the cutest and
nicest dog I ever saw!”</p>

<p>Patter wagged his tail that was stretched
out on the ground, and as he did so he brushed
aside some sand and gravel from the walk.</p>

<p>“His tail is like a dusting brush, isn’t it?”
said Sue.</p>

<p>“I wish I had him in my house,” remarked
Mrs. Nelson, with a laugh. “He could dust
my furniture. I’ve been so busy since I
started working for the church fair that I
haven’t had time to do much dusting.”</p>

<p>By this time Patter thought he had held the
basket long enough. He dropped down to
all four feet and walked over to Bunny with
the basket in his mouth, as if asking what he
should do with it.</p>

<p>“It’s my basket, if you please, Patter,” said
Mrs. Jones. “I’ll take it now, but I’ll get
you another in which to take tickets at the
door when we have our fair. Give me the
basket please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>As if he understood, Patter walked over
and let Mrs. Jones take the basket from his
mouth.</p>

<p>And then, while Bunny and Sue romped
with their trick dog, the ladies talked to Mrs.
Brown about having Patter take tickets at the
fair.</p>

<small>PATTER AND THE KITTEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a great deal of work to be done
whenever a church fair is held. Bunny and
Sue did not know this, but it is true. Mrs.
Brown and her friends were kept very busy,
and when Bunny asked when he and Sue could
take Patter to the opera house, where the fair
was to be held, and make him stand up and
hold the ticket basket, Mrs. Brown said:</p>

<p>“It will not be until next week.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I’m going to keep on teaching
Patter and Wango to swing in the trapeze,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Will you have the dog and the monkey
do tricks at the church fair, Mother?” Sue
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” said Mrs. Brown.
“I’m afraid it could not well be done with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
other things we have planned. I guess we’ll
just have Patter alone at the fair.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather it would be that way,” said
Bunny. “’Cause if we do the dog and monkey
and trapeze trick at the fair, people
wouldn’t want to come and see it when we
have a show of our own.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right,” agreed Sue.</p>

<p>George and the other boys were a little disappointed
when Bunny told them the trapeze
trick could not be done at the fair. But they
shouted with glee when told how Patter had
held the basket and how it was planned to
make him do it at the door on the nights when
the church fair would be held.</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s going to do that we’d better
make him practice now,” suggested Charlie
Star.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Bunny. “I’ll get a
basket.”</p>

<p>He brought one out from the house, and
no sooner did Patter see his little master with
the basket than the dog ran to him and gently
took it from Bunny’s hand. Then Patter sat
up on his hind legs, as if “begging.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Who taught him that trick?” asked
Charlie Star.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Bunny answered. “But I
guess it must have been that Frenchman who
gave the dog to my father. He must have
taught Patter a lot of tricks we don’t know
anything about.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as he holds up the basket,
let’s pretend we’re ladies at the church fair,
and we’ll make believe put tickets in the
basket,” suggested George. “This will get
Patter used to doing it.”</p>

<p>“How can we be ladies when we haven’t got
long hair?” asked Charlie Star, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“We haven’t got anything for tickets,” objected
Harry.</p>

<p>“Use little stones for tickets,” suggested
George. “And if any of you want long hair
to make believe you’re ladies, put on some of
those carpenter shavings for curls.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a corner where a carpenter
had been doing some work at the Brown house
and had left a pile of curled shavings. With
whoops of delight the boys swooped down on
these and fastened them up under their caps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
so that the “curls” hung down on either side
of their faces.</p>

<p>“Now we’re ladies at the church fair, and
we must each drop a ticket in the dog’s
basket,” said George.</p>

<p>So the boys, with their false curls of shavings,
marched in Indian file up to Patter, sitting
on his hind legs holding the basket. And
as the lads passed they each dropped a stone
in as a ticket.</p>

<p>“He does it fine!” exclaimed George, when
Patter never moved, but sat there like a stone
statue of a dog. “He’s a fine fellow, Bunny.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I like my trick dog very much,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>After each boy had put his “stone ticket”
into the basket, Patter was allowed to drop
the basket and romp around a bit, so he would
not get tired of standing in one position too
long.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better practice him a bit on
the trapeze,” said Bunny, after the ticket taking
had been gone through with for the third
time.</p>

<p>“It would be a good idea,” said George.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“We ought to have the monkey, though, to get
Patter used to him.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see if we can get Wango,”
suggested Harry.</p>

<p>The boys went over to the home of the old
sailor. Usually Wango was outside on the
porch, if the weather was warm enough, and
it was now, for it was summer. But to-day
no Wango could be seen. Miss Euphemia
Winkler, Jed’s sister, was there, however, and
she seemed very busy about something.</p>

<p>“What do you boys want?” she demanded
rather crossly, as she saw them stop just outside
the fence.</p>

<p>“Please, Miss Winkler,” began Bunny,
“could we take Wango a little while? We’ll
be sure to——”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak to <i>me</i> about that horrid monkey!”
cried Miss Winkler, shaking her broom
at the boys. “I never want to see him again.
If he were here you could take him and welcome,
but he isn’t here!”</p>

<p>“Where’s he gone, if you please?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me! I hope he’s gone back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
China, or India, or wherever it was my
brother was foolish enough to bring him from!
I never want to see him again—the monkey I
mean!” added Miss Winkler quickly. “Look
at the work he made me!”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Why, when I was baking cookies he
swooped down off the mantel and grabbed
both paws full,” said Miss Winkler, as she
went on sweeping dirt from the porch.
“Then, when I chased him, he ran out here
and grabbed up two flower pots and threw
them at me. The pots smashed and the dirt
flew all over! Oh, I never saw such a
monkey!”</p>

<p>The boys watched her for a few seconds and
then Bunny said in a low voice to the others:</p>

<p>“There’s no use waiting for Wango to come
back. He won’t come as long as he sees Miss
Winkler there with a broom. He’ll think she
wants to beat him.”</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose Wango is?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he’s hiding around in the
trees,” Bunny answered. “That’s where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
runs to when Miss Winkler takes after him.
Come on, we’ll go back and make Patter do
his trapeze trick alone.”</p>

<p>On their way back the boys looked up in
the trees they passed for a sight of Wango, but
they saw nothing of the pet monkey. Then
they turned toward Bunny’s house to go out to
the barn and give Patter some practice on the
trapeze.</p>

<p>When nearly at his house Bunny and his
chums saw Bunker Blue driving along the
street in one of Mr. Brown’s delivery autos.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunker, give us a ride home!” called
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Can’t!” answered the red-haired lad.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m going to the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Are you sick, or is it the auto?” asked
George.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see a sick old man,” went on
Bunker. “He’s the one who came to your
house the night you got the trick dog, Bunny,”
explained the dock boy. “Your father is sending
him some nice fresh fish, for he is better
now and can sit up and eat. If I wasn’t going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
to the hospital I’d ride you boys home,”
said Bunker.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Hospitals come first,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Maybe we could go to see the old man and
take Patter along and have him do some
tricks,” suggested Charlie Star. “It would
cheer the old man up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask him if he wants to see you,” promised
Bunker Blue, as he kept on in the automobile.</p>

<p>The boys went to the barn and there Patter
was dressed up in the clown suit of red, white
and blue that he wore when he first did tricks
for Bunny and Sue. The boys had some
trouble putting it on Patter, but finally managed
to do it.</p>

<p>“He looks just like a circus dog,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bunny, “I guess maybe he
was in a circus before the Frenchman had
him.”</p>

<p>Patter did not object to being dressed in his
clown suit, nor did he mind jumping up on
the trapeze board and swinging there. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
fact he was a very good-natured dog, doing
all the tricks he knew cheerfully, and as many
times as he was asked.</p>

<p>“If he takes tickets in the church fair, your
dog ought to have a different suit, Bunny,”
said Charlie.</p>

<p>“He ought to be dressed in orange and
black, or something like that,” added Harry.
“Sort of a Hallowe’en, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask mother to make him a new suit,”
offered Bunny.</p>

<p>When this matter was spoken of to Mrs.
Brown she said that some of the ladies of the
church were making a new suit for the dog.</p>

<p>A few days later came the time for the
church fair. It was to be held in the opera
house. At first none of the boys or girls who
were Sue’s or Bunny’s friends had intended to
go, but when it became known that Patter
would be there, more young folks said they
would attend. They wanted to see the dog
take tickets.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As Mrs. Brown had said, two of the ladies
on the committee had planned a new suit for
Patter, and the day before the fair they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
brought it home. It was yellow and black
and had spangles on it that glittered in the
light.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is a fine suit for our dog!” cried
Bunny. “Could we keep it for him until we
have our own show?”</p>

<p>The ladies said the suit was Patter’s to keep
forever, and it would belong to Bunny and
Sue just as the dog did.</p>

<p>Whether it was the news that Patter would
“take tickets” at the church fair or whether
it was some other attraction, I do not know,
but it is true that a large crowd made its way
toward the opera house the night the fair
opened.</p>

<p>At the door, in his new suit, holding in his
mouth a basket for the tickets, sat Patter.
Near him were Bunny and Sue to make sure
that Patter would not drop the basket.</p>

<p>Person after person came to the fair, looked
at the dog holding the basket, and then, with
a laugh, dropped in his admission ticket.</p>

<p>The basket was nearly full and Bunny was
thinking of emptying it when Sue gave a sudden
cry and pointed to something coming in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
one of the opened windows. For the part of
the opera house where the church fair was
held was on the ground floor. Shows and entertainments
took place upstairs.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Sue. “There’s a
black kitten with white feet.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make much difference what kind
of feet she has,” said Bunny quickly. “But if
that’s a kitten she’d better not let Patter see
her. He doesn’t like cats.”</p>

<p>As Bunny spoke this word “cats,” Patter
pricked up his ears as if he knew what was
said. Then he looked around and saw the
pussy on the window sill, inside the church-fair
hall. In another moment Patter dropped
the basket of tickets, which scattered all about,
and the dog, with a loud bark, raced across the
room to get the kitten.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>WHITEFEET’S TRICK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Patter barked the kitten made a big
mistake. Instead of jumping off the window
sill to the ground outside, for the window was
open, the little black cat with white feet leaped
down inside the room where the fair was being
held.</p>

<p>This was just what Patter wanted for now
he could chase the little cat as much as he
liked, and he raced after her as fast as he could
run. In and out among the chairs and tables
ran Patter, barking and whining, so eager he
was to catch Whitefeet, which was the cat’s
name.</p>

<p>But Whitefeet did not want to be caught.
She, also, ran in and out among the tables and
chairs, her back slightly arched up and her
tail fluffed out and as big as a small sausage.</p>

<p>Men and women, boys and girls rushed here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and there after the dog and the kitten, calling
to them, screaming and shouting.</p>

<p>“Patter! Patter! Come here! Stop it!”
cried Bunny. He had picked up the basket
his trick dog had been holding in his mouth
to collect the tickets those coming to the fair
had dropped into it. As for the tickets, they
were scattered all over the room. “Patter,
stop it! Come here!” cried Bunny again and
again.</p>

<p>But though the dog generally minded very
well, this time he did not mind. He paid no
attention to Bunny Brown or to Sue. For Sue
also called to her pet.</p>

<p>“Something must be done!” cried Mrs.
Jones, one of the ladies managing the affair.
“Won’t some one catch that dog?”</p>

<p>“Somebody ought to catch the cat, and then
the dog would stop running,” said Mrs. Star.
“Don’t try to catch your dog, Bunny,” she went
on. “See if you can’t get the cat!”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, yes’m,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Chase the cat out of the window,” called
some one else.</p>

<p>“Whose cat is it, anyhow?” asked Bunker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Blue. He had been sent to the church fair by
Mr. Brown, and Bunker was to help dish out
the ice cream and do things like that.</p>

<p>“It’s a new cat,” said Bunny, as he ran
around the room after his dog. “I never saw
her before.”</p>

<p>There was a regular race to catch Patter
and Whitefeet, though by this time it was
mostly the boys who were running around—Bunny
and his chums Charlie, George, and
Harry, with a few others. Most of the women
were laughing so hard they could not do much
chasing, and the men were also chuckling at
the sides of the room. The girls, too, except
Sue, had given up trying to catch either the
dog or the cat, but Sue ran around with Bunny,
for she wanted to help him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little black cat with the white
feet made a quick turn and darted beneath a
table on which were some artificial paper
flowers that a lady and her daughter had made
to sell for the aid of the church. It was not
a very heavy table, and as the cat ran under
it Patter tried to follow.</p>

<p>Now Patter was much larger than the cat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and though Whitefeet could slip between the
legs of the table, the dog could not. Patter
tried it, but “he got stuck,” as Bunny said
afterward, and upset the table. Over it went,
the paper flowers scattering all about.</p>

<p>One wreath fell right around Patter’s neck
and remained there, and as he leaped out from
beneath the table he had flowers twined about
him, looking like some prize-decorated dog.</p>

<p>But Patter did not mind this at all. On
he ran, barking and whining in his eagerness
to get the cat. Whitefeet was now headed
for a table on which cups of tea had been set
out for those who wished to buy this to drink.</p>

<p>“Oh, if they upset the tea table it will be
terrible!” screamed Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>“Don’t let them!” cried Mrs. Rogers, as if
she could stop it that way.</p>

<p>All the committee ladies, standing around
the walls of the room, knowing they could not
reach the table in time to save it, gasped with
fear as they saw Whitefeet headed for the tea
table. If the cat ran under that and Patter
followed there would be a great crash of china
cups and saucers, as well as a great spilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of hot tea. Upsetting the flower table was not
so bad, but to upset the tea table would be
dreadful!</p>

<p>However, almost at the last second, the
black cat with the white feet turned aside and
did not run under the table. Patter also
turned and did not hit the table legs. The
cat now ran down the long room.</p>

<p>But Patter was not to be fooled this way.
On he kept after the cat, and behind the two
animals came four or five boys, led by Bunny.
The little Brown chap was sorry his dog acted
this way. He had never seen Patter chase
cats before, but of course it was natural for a
dog to do it.</p>

<p>“Patter! Patter!” cried Bunny again and
again. But Patter did not heed his master’s
voice, this time, at any rate. Nor did Sue have
any better luck when calling Patter to her.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the room, toward which
the cat was now headed with Patter after her,
was a table of fancy cakes. It was almost as
small and light a table as that on which the
paper flowers had been piled. Behind it
stood an elderly lady who had made most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the cakes herself, intending to sell them for
the benefit of the church. This elderly lady
saw the dog and the cat and the crowd of chasing
boys coming toward her table of cakes,
and she cried:</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! Don’t come a bit closer! I
won’t have my table upset! Stop!”</p>

<p>She might just as well “have talked to the
wind,” said Bunker Blue, afterward. For
the cat did not stop, nor did Patter, and of
course on came Bunny Brown and his boy
chums, hoping to catch Patter or the cat before
more damage was done.</p>

<p>But it was too late. Under the table shot
the cat. Patter again tried to follow, but he
became tangled up in the table legs. Over
went the table, cakes and all, the cakes scattering
all over the floor. And as some of
the cakes were round they rolled into far
corners.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness! Oh, this is terrible!”
exclaimed the elderly lady who had baked the
cakes.</p>

<p>“Something must be done!” cried Mrs.
Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Out from under the upset table of cakes
crawled Patter, to keep on after Whitefeet.
Some of the ladies hurried to right the fallen
table, and others began to pick up the scattered
cakes.</p>

<p>“We could help do that,” said George to
Harry. “Maybe if we picked up all the cakes
they’d give us some to eat for nothing.
There’s no use chasing that cat and dog any
longer.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” agreed Harry. “Come on,
we’ll pick up the cakes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they won’t want any of ’em back,
as long as they’ve been on the floor, and we
can keep ’em all,” suggested George.</p>

<p>“That would be great!” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>So the two boys began to pick up the fallen
cakes, but Bunny, Sue and Charlie raced on
after the dog and the cat.</p>

<p>However, the chase soon came to an end
now. By some mistake Whitefeet darted into
a part of the room where there were no tables
or chairs under which she could run. It was
a corner, and Patter had her cornered there.
Seeing nothing ahead of her but solid walls the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
cat suddenly turned and faced the dog, her
back arched higher than ever and her tail
bigger than before. Also she began to hiss.</p>

<p>“Look out, Patter! Look out!” cried
Bunny. “She’ll scratch your nose!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let his nose be scratched! He’ll
bleed!” yelled Sue.</p>

<p>But Patter did not intend to get his nose
scratched. He must have known more about
cats than either Bunny or Sue supposed. For
when he saw that Whitefeet could not run any
farther he did not rush up to her and bite her.
Instead, he just sat up on his hind legs in front
of the cat, as he had sat up when he held the
basket for tickets.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” exclaimed Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a cute, queer dog!”
remarked Mrs. Marshall. “He seems to be
begging the cat’s pardon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny, he’s doing a trick!” cried Sue.
And, as it turned out, this is what Patter
wanted to do. After he had stood up on his
hind legs for a moment in front of the cat,
whining softly as if he wanted to speak to her,
the dog got down on all fours and turned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
back toward Whitefeet. Then he stood as if
waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>The cat seemed surprised that she was not
bitten or taken up in the dog’s mouth and
shaken. It was something new for her, evidently,
not to be badly treated by dogs. True,
this dog had chased her, but that was all. He
did not bite her.</p>

<p>Then the cat seemed to lose her fear. Her
tail became smaller and the arch went down
out of her back. She no longer hissed. But
Patter was acting in a strange manner. He
whined, he wagged his tail, and he kept looking
around at Whitefeet.</p>

<p>“What does he want?” asked Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Bunny answered, as much
puzzled as the rest. “He acts that way sometimes
before I have him do a trick, but——”</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Brown pushed his way
through the crowd that stood in front of Patter
and Whitefeet in the corner. Mr. Brown
had just arrived at the church fair.</p>

<p>“Patter wants the cat on his back, that’s
what he wants,” said Bunny’s father. “It’s
one of his tricks. He used to perform with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
trained cat, and one trick was that a cat would
sit on his back and Patter would march around
that way. I got a letter from the Frenchman
to-day. In it he told me this was one of the
tricks he forgot to mention. Try it, Bunny.
Put the cat on Patter’s back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be a lovely trick—if they
do it,” said Sue.</p>

<p>That was the point. Would Whitefeet allow
herself to be put on Patter’s back? The
trick dog seemed ready to do his part.</p>

<p>“Here, better let me do it,” said Mr. Brown.
“The cat might scratch you, Bunny.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown spoke gently to the black kitten
with the white feet and picked her up. He
stroked her softly, rubbed her under her ears,
at which she tilted her head and stretched out
her neck as if she loved to be petted that way.
Then Mr. Brown taught Whitefeet her first
trick. He set her on Patter’s back.</p>

<p>The little cat remained there a moment, but
just as Patter started to walk around, as he had
been in the habit of doing, Whitefeet jumped
down.</p>

<p>“Oh, she won’t do it,” sighed Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“I’ll try again,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Once more he put Whitefeet up on Patter’s
back, and this time the cat remained. She
settled down as if contented and comfortable.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that cute!” and “Just look at
that!” cried the people who were watching the
trick dog and the little cat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>PATTER AND THE CRAB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Patter</span> now seemed to have matters just as
he wanted them. He had gotten his wish—that
is if dogs ever wish—for he had the little
black cat, with her four white feet, up on his
back. And, once he had her there, he began
marching around. Later on Bunny and Sue
learned that this is just what Patter used to do
in the show where the Frenchman exhibited
him.</p>

<p>Down the long room, lined on either side
with the church-fair tables, marched the dog
with the cat on his back. Patter seemed
rather proud of what he was doing, and the
cat appeared to like it—that is, as much as
cats like anything of the sort. Cats are not as
fond of doing tricks as dogs are. They are,
Bunker Blue used to say, “rather stuck-up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>But, though Whitefeet might seem proud
and “stuck-up,” she did not offer to jump off
Patter’s back. Perhaps she had been taught
to do this by some boy or girl where she formerly
lived. As I have told you, the cat was
a strange one in the neighborhood of the opera
house. None of the boys or girls remembered
to have seen her before.</p>

<p>Perhaps the cat had been trained to sit on
some boy’s or girl’s shoulder and be carried
around the room this way, as I once had a cat
do. And after finding out that Patter was not
going to harm her, this cat may have thought
she was riding on the shoulder of some one.</p>

<p>At any rate, she did not offer to get off the
dog’s back, and those at the church fair saw
the novel sight of Patter parading around with
Whitefeet.</p>

<p>“If we had known he was going to do a
trick like that we could have advertised it,”
said Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’s a good thing we didn’t,”
said Mrs. Nelson. “If we had, Patter might
not have done it or the cat might have
scratched him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“That’s so,” agreed Mrs. Jones. “Anyhow,
Patter was very cute when he held the basket
of tickets.”</p>

<p>“And I think we’d better have him do it
again,” said Mrs. Nelson. “More people are
coming to the fair, and we want them to see
what we promised—a dog taking tickets at the
door.”</p>

<p>“In that case, we’ll have to get the cat off
his back,” remarked Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have to straighten up the cake
and flower tables,” commented Mrs. Watson.
“This place is a <i>sight</i>!”</p>

<p>Indeed, the once orderly room where the
church fair was being held was now in confusion,
especially where the boys were trying
to pick up the scattered cakes. The tossed-about
paper flowers had been gathered up, not
much the worse for the accident, except the
wreath that had fallen about Patter’s neck.</p>

<p>The dog still had this gay ornament on him,
and was walking along with one end dragging
on the floor while Whitefeet still sat on his
back. People crowded around to look at the
odd sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Then Whitefeet seemed to have done her
trick long enough. For, with a gentle
“meow” she leaped down to the floor, though
she did not try to run away. Patter turned,
looked at her and barked a little as if inviting
her to get on his back once more, but Whitefeet
would not do this.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take that kittie home!” declared
Sue, as she picked Whitefeet up in her
arms. The kitten did not seem to mind, and
as no one else claimed the pet Sue was allowed
to keep her.</p>

<p>“We’ll have her ride around on Patter’s
back when we get up our show,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“That will be great!” exclaimed Charlie
Star. “Lots of people will come to see that.”</p>

<p>“Bunny, do you think you could make your
dog hold the ticket basket again?” asked Mrs.
Jones.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes’m!” said Bunny. “I’ll take these
flowers off and——”</p>

<p>“No, leave the wreath on him,” suggested
Mrs. Jones. “It looks cute. That is, if he’ll
let it stay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t seem to mind it,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Bunny. “Come on, Patter,” he called. “You
have to be ticket-taker again.”</p>

<p>Patter seemed to have had enough of riding
Whitefeet on his back, at least for a time,
so the trick dog willingly went with Bunny
to the door and again sat up on his hind legs,
the wreath of paper flowers around his neck,
holding in his mouth the basket into which
people dropped tickets.</p>

<p>The room, which had been upset by the dog
and cat chase, was put in order, the flower
table being prettily arranged again. As for
the cakes—well, some of them were sadly
broken.</p>

<p>“We picked up all we could find,” said
George.</p>

<p>“And I stepped on one,” said Harry. “I
couldn’t help it, but I guess if you scrape off
the top part it’ll be all right. Maybe nobody
will see it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, boys, for picking up the
cakes,” said Mrs. Pallin, who had charge of
that table. “But I don’t want them back.
You may have them. I couldn’t sell cakes
that had been on the floor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Come on, then!” cried Harry. “Maybe
we can find more.”</p>

<p>Other boys began searching for the cakes,
some of which had rolled into far corners.
Luckily most of the dainties had been in
baskets, which had tipped over when the table
had upset, and not all had spilled out. So
there were still plenty that were clean and unbroken
left to be sold. The accident was not
so bad as had seemed at first.</p>

<p>Order was now once more restored. Patter
was at his place, taking tickets at the door, and
Sue and some of her girl friends were petting
Whitefeet in one corner of the room. The
church fair was well under way.</p>

<p>“We never had such a success, Mrs.
Brown,” said Mrs. Jones to the mother of
Bunny and Sue. “Your children have been
very helpful, and as for Patter—he is invaluable!”</p>

<p>“Even when he chased after the cat?”
asked Mr. Brown with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, even then,” said Mrs. Jones. “For
it made excitement, and a lot of people, who
wouldn’t otherwise have come in, entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
from the street to see what it was all about.
And now we have them here we’ll make them
spend money for the church,” she added, with
a laugh. “That’s what church fairs are for.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>After a while, when it was seen that few
more were coming in with tickets, Patter was
allowed to give up his basket, for they did not
want to tire him by making him sit up too
long. But he had proved a great “attraction,”
as a Bellemere newspaper said the next
day.</p>

<p>Bunny and his chums, after eating the
cleanest of the cakes that had been toppled
to the floor, went off by themselves into a side
room and began putting Patter through some
of his tricks.</p>

<p>“Let’s get the cat again and see if he’ll let
her get up on his back,” suggested Charlie.
“If he’s going to do it in our show we’d better
have him practice.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>Sue brought in Whitefeet, and the dog and
cat resumed friendship at once, the cat even
rubbing up against Patter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Bunny put the cat on the dog’s back. She
curled up there as if she liked the warm,
shaggy coat of hair, and Patter walked around
again with Whitefeet on his back.</p>

<p>“Don’t make her do it too long or she’ll get
tired and cross,” suggested Sue. So they gave
her back the little cat, and then the boys got
Patter to do some of the tricks he had often
done for them as they romped through the
fields.</p>

<p>As the boys were doing this Mr. Martin,
one of the men who was helping with the fair,
looked into the room and saw Patter marching
around like a soldier, with a stick over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good,” said Mr. Martin.
“Will your dog do tricks before an audience,
Bunny?”</p>

<p>“I guess he will, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Will you please bring him upstairs to the
stage? I want him to do some tricks on the
stage.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got his clown suit on,” Bunny
objected.</p>

<p>“No matter,” replied Mr. Martin. “He’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
do as he is. That orange and black suit is
fine! One of the performers who was going
to sing is late, and I want to amuse the audience
while there’s a wait. Your dog will just
do for that. Bring him up on the stage.”</p>

<p>“He won’t do tricks unless I tell him to,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You can go on the stage,”
said the man.</p>

<p>“Hurray! Bunny’s going on the stage!”
cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t the first time,” said George,
for they all remembered the show Bunny and
Sue had given.</p>

<p>Up to the opera house proper went Bunny
and Patter. Mr. Martin went out in front
of the curtain and explained to the audience
that while they were waiting for the singer,
Bunny Brown and his trick dog would amuse
them.</p>

<p>Up went the curtain and out stepped Bunny
and Patter. There was not a very large audience,
for many persons were still in the lower
room, buying things at the church fair. But
there was enough of a crowd, and many it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
knew Bunny Brown. They clapped their
hands when he made his bow, and when Patter
also bowed there was more clapping.</p>

<p>Bunny put his dog through a few simple
tricks, and these seemed to please the men and
women. Of course if Bunny had practiced
and had known he was going to give a performance
with his dog, it would have been
much better. But it was very well as it was,
Mr. Martin said, and served to make the people
laugh and the time pass until the belated
singer appeared.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Bunny, for helping
us,” said Mr. Martin, when the boy and dog
went off the stage.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Bunny, with a
smile. “Pretty soon I’m going to give a regular
show—Sue and some of the fellows and I.
And Patter is going to be in that.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll come to see it and bring as many
friends as I can,” promised Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>As the church fair would last rather late
and as Mrs. Brown did not want Bunny and
Sue to lose too much sleep, she sent them home
with Bunker Blue at about half past nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
o’clock. Patter went with Bunny, and Sue
insisted on carrying Whitefeet to the automobile,
in which the trip home was made.</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep that cat?” asked
Bunker.</p>

<p>“Course I am. She’s mine!” declared Sue.</p>

<p>“I reckon she is until some one claims her,”
said Bunker.</p>

<p>“Maybe nobody will,” suggested Bunny.</p>

<p>And no one did. Where the dear little
black kitten, with her four white feet had
come from, no one seemed to know. She had
“just growed, like Topsy in Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” decided Sue when several days had
passed and no one came to take Whitefeet
away.</p>

<p>The church fair was a great success, and
Bunny Brown and his sister Sue, to say nothing
of their pet dog, had a large share in it.
The newspaper said so, and that ought to
prove it if anything could.</p>

<p>It was several days after the fair that Bunny
and his boy chums were roaming over the
fields with Patter.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up Turtle River and catch some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
crabs,” suggested George. “Hard crabs are
running fine now, and we can sell ’em and
make some money.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Charlie. “But let’s go
to my house and get the lines, some bait, and
a net. Can’t catch crabs without a net.”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” laughed Bunny. “Not if
you don’t want to get pinched.”</p>

<p>The boys stopped at Charlie’s house, got
some strong lines and bits of old meat, which
makes the best crab bait. They also got a
long-handled net with which to lift the crabs
from the water and a peach basket in which
to keep the crabs if they caught any.</p>

<p>In fishing for crabs you don’t use a hook
on your line. A piece of meat, dangling on
a string, is all that is needed. The crab swims
up to the meat, grasps it in strong claws and
starts to eat. Then if the line is lifted gently
from the water the crab is lifted up with it.
Slip the net under him before he lets go, and
you have caught Mr. Crab.</p>

<p>Turtle River, into which the salt sea water
from Sandport Bay flowed, was a fine place
for crabs, and soon the boys had caught the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
peach basket nearly full. The crabs clashed
and clattered their hard shells in the basket,
pinching one another and sticking their claws
out through the cracks in the basket. Patter
sat on the bank near the basket, wisely watching
Bunny and his chums.</p>

<p>In lifting up one large crab in the net
Bunny’s hands slipped and, before he knew
it, the crab had fallen out on the ground near
the spot where Patter sat. At once Patter
leaped up and began barking at the crab, and
pawing at it.</p>

<p>“Let that crab alone, Patter!” cried Bunny.
“He’ll pinch you. Let it alone!”</p>

<p>But the warning was too late! With a snap
of its claws the crab fastened on Patter’s paw,
and the next moment Patter gave forth a howl
and began rushing around on three legs.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>ADRIFT IN A BOAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Patter!</span> Patter! I told you to keep away
from the crab!” shouted Bunny Brown, when
he saw what had happened to his trick dog.</p>

<p>“Wow! Wow!” howled Patter, limping
along and holding up the paw to which the
crab—a large one—had fastened itself. “Bow-wow!”</p>

<p>“Knock the crab off!”</p>

<p>“Smash him!”</p>

<p>“Give the crab a piece of meat and he’ll
let go the dog!”</p>

<p>Charlie, Harry and George cried this advice
to Bunny as he ran along after Patter,
seeking to help his pet.</p>

<p>Crabs can pinch very hard, as any of you
knows who has been unlucky enough to be
nipped by one. I have had even a small one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
draw blood when he closed his pinchers on my
thumb.</p>

<p>And as this crab was a large one, with powerful
claws, it had a good grip on poor Patter’s
paw. Luckily the dog’s paw was tough,
and was covered with hair which was like a
cushion, or a glove, so the crab did not break
the skin or draw blood.</p>

<p>But it pinched hard enough to make Patter
howl, and Bunny was afraid his trick dog
might run away and be lost. So the boy raced
after his four-legged chum calling:</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Patter! Wait a minute
and I’ll take the crab off your paw!”</p>

<p>“Better not do that,” advised George.
“Knock the crab off with a stick. If you try
to pull it off you’ll get pinched, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess maybe I shall,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>He caught up a stick and ran until he was
close enough to reach Patter.</p>

<p>“Sit up!” commanded Bunny, as he knew
if the dog did this it would be easier to knock
off the pinching crab.</p>

<p>Patter did as he was told. Even though
howling from pain he obeyed his master’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
voice. Then, when he was sitting on his hind
legs with the paw to which the crab was fastened
held pitifully out, Bunny swung his stick
and hit the hard shell of the crab a resounding
blow.</p>

<p>The result was that the one claw, by which
the crab was then hanging, was broken off.
Crabs’ claws are easily broken, and it does not
seem to hurt the creature. There is a saying
that crabs’ claws will grow back on again, but
I am not certain of this. I have caught a
great many crabs with only one claw—large
crabs, too—and it seems to me that if they
were going to grow a new claw, in place of
the one they have lost, a little claw would
have started growing. And this I have never
seen.</p>

<p>Anyhow, by knocking the crab from Patter’s
paw the claw of the sea-creature was
broken off and left hanging on the dog’s foot,
though it no longer pinched. The one-clawed
crab scuttled off sideways, which is the way
crabs “walk” on dry land, and also the way
they often swim, though sometimes they dart
backward in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Catch the crab!” cried George. “Don’t
let it get away! It’s a big one and full of
meat!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” offered Charlie, while Bunny
began taking the loose claw from Patter’s
leg.</p>

<p>There is a certain way to pick up a crab in
your hand so he cannot pinch you, and Bunny
and his chums, being “salt water boys,” knew
how to do this.</p>

<p>Charlie first put one foot lightly on the
crab, hard enough to hold the crawling creature
from moving, but not hard enough to
crush the upper shell, with its sharp, sticking
points. Charlie then reached down and took
hold, between his thumb and one finger, of one
of the hind “flippers” or swimming legs of the
crab, close to where it joined the shell. Held
thus, the crab could not reach around with its
one remaining claw to pinch Charlie. The
boy lifted the crab from under his shoe and
tossed the squirming creature into the basket
with the other crabs.</p>

<p>“Can you get the claw off Patter’s leg?”
asked George of Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Yes, I got it off,” was the answer. “But
it was stuck pretty tight.”</p>

<p>Even after a crab’s claw is torn from its
body the claw will still cling, for it has sharp
points that lock like a spring trap.</p>

<p>Patter stopped howling and began to lick
his slightly injured paw. Bunny watched his
pet trick dog anxiously.</p>

<p>“I hope he won’t be lame,” he said. “If
he’s lame he can’t do his tricks so well.”</p>

<p>Patter limped a little when he put his
pinched paw down on the ground, but this
soon wore off and a little later he was romping
around as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>But the next time one of the crabs got out
of the net and began to scramble around on the
ground, Patter took care to be far away. He
barked and whined at the crab, but he did not
put a paw near it. He had learned a lesson.</p>

<p>“Well, we have enough crabs,” said Charlie,
after a while.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s go sell ’em,” suggested George.</p>

<p>It was not as easy to sell hard-shelled crabs
in Bellemere as it would have been in a town
farther away from the seacoast, for in Bellemere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
those who wished this form of sea food
generally caught their own crabs. Still the
boys had peddled crabs before.</p>

<p>Putting a stick through the slots in the sides
of the peach basket and covering the crabs
with wet seaweed to keep them alive—for it
is dangerous to one’s health to cook and eat a
dead crab—the chums started off on their peddling
trip, followed by Patter.</p>

<p>“Want to buy any crabs, Mrs. Jones?” asked
George, as the boys appeared at the back door
of the lady who had helped to get up the
church fair.</p>

<p>“Hard or soft?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Hard,” answered George.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” she answered, with a
smile. “They’re too much trouble. If you
had some soft crabs now, I’d take a dozen.
Mr. Jones is very fond of soft-shelled crabs
on toast.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to get you some soft crabs this
afternoon,” offered Bunny. “But they’re
scarce, I heard Bunker Blue say.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s why my husband wants
some,” went on Mrs. Jones. “People often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
want strawberries in January and soft crabs
when they’re hard to get. Well, if you find
any bring them to me. But I can’t use the
hard kind.”</p>

<p>I might explain that a soft crab is one that
has just shed its hard shell. Soft crabs are delicious
fried in butter and put on a piece of
toast. The only way to cook hard crabs is to
boil them alive and pick out the meat, which
is quite a lot of work. But, as Bunny had said,
soft crabs were scarce. They are also much
harder to catch than hard crabs.</p>

<p>When a hard crab grows, it finds its shell
too small for it. The creature then bursts out
from its horn-like casing. Once it is out it is
soft and flabby. It hides away under the seaweed
and only sharp eyes can find it. Soft
crabs are scooped up in a net, as their claws
are so flabby they cannot cling to the bait or
piece of meat on a string.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to try somewhere else,”
said Bunny, as they walked out of Mrs. Jones’
yard with the basket.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Harry. “Somebody will
want hard crabs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>After many calls the boys at last succeeded
in selling the basket of hard crabs to Mrs.
Hampton for fifty cents. This gave them
twelve and a half cents each, and they were
quite satisfied with their work.</p>

<p>“It was fun, anyhow,” said Bunny, as they
divided the money; buying candy with the odd
two cents and passing that around.</p>

<p>Sue was a little worried that evening when
Bunny told her that the crab had pinched Patter.
But when she had looked at the dog’s
paw and could see no wound, she felt better.</p>

<p>“See if he’ll do his tricks,” she suggested.</p>

<p>And as Patter did them as well as ever, his
little friends knew he was all right again.</p>

<p>“We must soon get ready for our show,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sue. “And I’ll make a new
suit for Patter. I’ll make it of silver and gold—like
a fairy suit.”</p>

<p>“That will do for one suit, besides the
Hallowe’en and his clown dress,” observed
Bunny. “But I think it would look different
if he had a tramp suit.”</p>

<p>“What you mean?” asked Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“I mean—I mean—well, in a circus or a
show lots of times a man comes all dressed up
like a ragged tramp, but he can do good tricks.
Maybe we could have one act where Patter
wore a ragged and torn suit like a tramp dog,
and people would be surprised.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fun!” agreed Sue. “I’ll
make a tramp suit, too, Bunny.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll make that,” said the boy. “You
mightn’t make it torn and ragged enough.
You make the gold and silver suit and I’ll
make the tramp suit.”</p>

<p>So it was agreed, and plans were made for
several new tricks it was hoped Patter would
perform. Each day he seemed to learn something
new, but the trick Bunny and his boy
chums liked best of all was where Patter
swung on the trapeze with Wango the
monkey.</p>

<p>This trick was practiced whenever they
could coax or borrow Wango from Mr.
Winkler, and this was pretty often. The trick
of having Whitefeet also ride on Patter’s back
was not forgotten.</p>

<p>“I’ll make him do that trick when we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the show, ’cause Whitefeet is my kittie,” declared
Sue.</p>

<p>And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Brown sent Bunny and Sue
down to the boat and fish dock with a note to
her husband. He had gone out for a little
while, but Bunker Blue said he would be back
soon and advised Bunny and his sister to wait.</p>

<p>“We’ll play in a boat while we’re waiting,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>There were many boats drawn up on the
shore of Sandport Bay near Mr. Brown’s
dock, and some boats were already in the
water. Bunny and Sue got in one that was
floating, and Patter scrambled in after them.
Quite a little wind was blowing, and the children
moved about in the boat, putting Patter
through some of his tricks.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bunny looked up, glanced about,
and cried:</p>

<p>“Sue, we’re going adrift!”</p>

<p>That meant the boat had become loosened
and was floating away. Already it was some
distance out in the bay, and there were no
people near in other boats to go to the rescue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
of the children. As there were no oars
in their boat they could not row back to shore,
though had there been oars Bunny or Sue
could have handled them.</p>

<p>“Oh, what are we going to do?” cried Sue,
as the wind became stronger and stronger,
drifting them farther and farther from the
shore and their father’s dock.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>AT THE HOSPITAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunny Brown</span> and his sister Sue were not
afraid of being on the water in a boat. They
knew how to swim, and they had paddled and
rowed around Sandport Bay often enough to
know how to handle a small boat.</p>

<p>But it was different—this being out in a boat
with no oars. Bunny or Sue would never
have done that of their own accord, for they
knew how easy it was to drift away. And,
if they had known the boat was not well fastened,
they would have seen to that before they
got in, for their father had taught them how
properly to tie a knot that would not slip, one
that would hold a boat securely and yet one
which was easy to loosen.</p>

<p>The boat that Bunny and Sue had gotten
in did not belong to their father, but to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
fisherman, though the children knew he
would not mind their playing in his craft.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t know the boat would come
loose!” said Sue, as they drifted out farther
and farther.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Bunny. “Somebody was
careless.”</p>

<p>He had often heard his father say that when
some other fisherman’s boats became loose and
drifted away.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do, Bunny?” asked
his sister, and it sounded as if the little girl
might cry, as indeed she was almost ready
to do.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can’t paddle back to shore with
my hands,” said Bunny, and he leaned over
the side of the boat.</p>

<p>“Don’t fall in!” warned Sue, as her mother
might have done.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Bunny. But he soon found
it was not very easy to paddle with his hands.
The wind blew him, his sister, and Patter
farther out from shore all the while, and by
this time the Brown boat and fish dock was
some distance down the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“We’d better call,” suggested Sue. “Then
maybe Bunker will come and get us, or maybe
daddy will.”</p>

<p>“All right—let’s call,” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>They shouted as loudly as they could, and
if the wind had been blowing in the right
direction probably they would have been
heard on their father’s dock, or by some of the
men in the fish house. But, as it was, the
wind was blowing the wrong way and carried
the voices of the children out to sea.</p>

<p>Just at this time, for some reason or other,
there were no other boats around Bunny and
Sue, though at most times there were plenty
of crafts coming and going. A fisherman, a
lobsterman, or any one who had seen the drifting
children and dog could soon have rowed
after them and brought them to shore.</p>

<p>The children soon gave up trying to shout
and make their voices carry to their father’s
dock. They knew enough about winds to feel
that they never could be heard the way it was
now blowing.</p>

<p>“There’s a man on shore. Maybe he’ll hear
us,” suggested Sue, pointing toward an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
fisherman who was spreading his nets out to
dry.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s call to him,” proposed
Bunny.</p>

<p>Again they shouted. But either the man
was deaf and did not hear them or, if he heard
the voices of the little boy and girl, he thought
they were just playing, or “cutting up,” as he
might have called it.</p>

<p>So this was of no use, and Bunny and Sue
began to feel a bit frightened. Still it was
early in the day, and though the wind blew
rather hard there was no sign of a storm. And
the children knew that before they drifted out
to sea some one would row out after them.</p>

<p>But it was not pleasant to feel that they were
drifting away, and Bunny and Sue wanted to
get to shore, or to their father’s dock, as soon
as they could.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do something, Bunny?” asked
Sue, after a while.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” suddenly cried the little girl.
“We can send Patter to shore to get somebody
to come after us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“How?” asked Bunny, for he did not quite
see this plan.</p>

<p>“Why,” went on Sue, “don’t you remember
how Patter used to jump into the water after
your cap?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll do that,” admitted Bunny.</p>

<p>“Then throw your cap into the water now,”
said Sue. “It’s an old one and won’t be
hurt.”</p>

<p>“But what good will it do?” asked Bunny.
“He’ll jump in and bring my cap back to me
here in the boat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’ll do that,” said Sue.
“Did he ever bring your cap to you in a boat,
Bunny?”</p>

<p>“No, he always brought it to shore.”</p>

<p>“And I guess he’ll do that now,” went on
Sue. “He’s used to taking caps to shore and
not to boats. If you throw your cap in he’ll
jump in after it and swim to the shore with
it. And then he’ll bark and maybe Bunker
Blue or somebody will hear him, and then
they can come out and get us.”</p>

<p>Bunny thought this over for a moment or
two. Then he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“I guess maybe that would be good. I’ll
do it.”</p>

<p>He took off his cap—an old one—and threw
it as far from the boat as he could toss it. Almost
as soon as it fell into the water, Patter
leaped overboard and swam toward the cap.</p>

<p>Now he was almost up to it—now he had
reached it. But would he turn and swim back
to the boat with it or would he carry it to
shore as Bunny and Sue hoped? Eagerly
they watched him.</p>

<p>Then it was Patter showed his training.
Never having been taught to take a cap to a
boat, he kept on swimming toward shore, as
he had always done when he leaped from the
bank of a stream and swam out to get the cloth
head-covering.</p>

<p>Naturally you would have thought that Patter
would swim back to where Bunny was,
whether on shore or in a boat. But the dog
did not. He seemed to think shore was the
proper place for caps that he took from the
water, and to shore he went.</p>

<p>Climbing out on the sandy beach, Patter
gave himself a shake to get rid of as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
water as possible, and then he laid the cap
down and began barking. Long and loud
barked Patter.</p>

<p>Now, it is a strange thing about the bark
of a dog. It can be heard farther than most
other sounds. Balloonists, carried high into
the air, say that the bark of a dog is the last
sound they can hear from the earth they are
leaving.</p>

<p>And so, as it happened, Patter’s barking
was heard when the calls of Bunny and Sue
had not been. Besides, Patter was on shore
and nearer the dock than the drifting boat.</p>

<p>Bunker Blue heard the dog’s barking cries.
At first the red-haired fish boy paid little attention
to the barking, but when Patter kept
it up for some time Bunker said:</p>

<p>“I wonder what ails that dog? He sounds
like Bunny’s.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go out and see,” suggested
one of the other men on the dock. Mr. Brown
had not yet come back.</p>

<p>“I will go,” said Bunker.</p>

<p>As he went out on the dock he looked up the
beach and saw Patter standing near Bunny’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
cap and barking. At first Bunker did not see
Bunny and Sue in the boat, which had, by this
time, drifted farther out. But Bunker knew
the trick dog, and he felt sure something was
wrong, for Bunny and Sue were never far
away from their pet.</p>

<p>Bunker ran up the beach toward Patter, and
then the fish boy saw Bunny’s cap. He knew
it at once.</p>

<p>“My goodness, I hope nothing has happened
to those children!” thought Bunker Blue. “I
hope they haven’t fallen overboard! Where
are they, Patter?” he asked. “Where are
Bunny and Sue?”</p>

<p>Patter’s only answer was to bark more
loudly. Then Bunker Blue looked across
the bay. He saw the drifting boat and his
sharp eyes made out in it the figures of two
children.</p>

<p>“That must be Bunny and Sue,” he said.
“I’ll go after them.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Bunker was rowing rapidly
out toward the drifting boat. Patter
jumped in with the fish boy, taking Bunny’s
wet cap with him. In about five minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Bunker had reached the drifting boat and had
made it fast to his own.</p>

<p>“What in the world did you two want to
come away out here for without any oars?”
he asked. “You ought to know better than
that!”</p>

<p>“We didn’t come—we were drifted out,”
said Bunny, telling exactly what had happened,
if not explaining very fully.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to look and make sure a
boat is fast before you get into it to play,”
scolded Bunker, as he began to row back to
shore.</p>

<p>“We will next time,” said Sue.</p>

<p>So the adventure ended happily, though
there might have been danger had no one seen
the children and gone after them. When Mr.
Brown came back to the dock and heard what
had happened, he made Bunny and Sue promise
to be more careful.</p>

<p>The children gave their father the message
sent by their mother and then, as the day was
still young, Mr. Brown said:</p>

<p>“I’m going to the hospital to see Jason Stern.
Do you children want to come with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Could we take Patter?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Who is Jason Stern?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“He is the old man who came to our house
the night you got Patter,” her father said.
“He’s in the hospital from an accident that
happened to him. I’m going to see him to
try to cheer him up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe if he could see Patter do some
tricks he’d cheer up more,” suggested Bunny.</p>

<p>“Maybe he would,” agreed his father. “So
come along to the hospital with me. The old
man seems to have no friends, and I take an
interest in him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown and the children were soon at
the hospital, going in an automobile with Patter
riding on the back seat as naturally as if
he belonged there.</p>

<p>“We’d like to see Mr. Stern,” said Daddy
Brown, when they entered the office of the
hospital.</p>

<p>“May I take my dog up and make him do
tricks?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“He means to make the dog do tricks,”
said Sue, as if afraid the nurse in the office
might think Mr. Stern had to do tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Yes, since Mr. Stern is now in the sun parlor,
and not in any of the wards or rooms,
it will be all right to take your dog up,” said
the nurse, with a smile. “I’m sure I hope
you can cheer him,” she added in a low voice
to Mr. Brown. “He doesn’t take any interest
in life, and he must, if he is to get well.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what we can do,” said Mr. Brown.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>SOMETHING NEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the hospital halls and corridors
went Bunny Brown and his sister Sue and
their trick dog, Mr. Brown coming along behind
and directing them which way to go,
as he had been in that part of the hospital
before. In the sun parlor were a number of
patients who were able to be out of bed, but
who were not yet well enough to go to their
homes or elsewhere.</p>

<p>“There he is, over in the corner by himself,”
said Mr. Brown to his children, when
he had looked around and had seen Mr. Stern.
And by the very fact that the poor old and
ragged man was thus sitting by himself, it
showed how much he needed cheering.</p>

<p>The other patients were grouped together,
listening to one who was telling them a story
and some happenings of his life, it seemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“How are you to-day, Mr. Stern?” asked
the children’s father.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m about the same,” was the low-voiced
answer. “Not much better. I guess
I’m never going to get any better. But it
doesn’t matter. I’m no good to anybody.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk that way,” said Mr.
Brown cheerfully. “You’ll be out of here
soon, and then we’ll see what can be done for
you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing much can be done for me,” went
on Mr. Stern, in sad tones. “If I could find
Jim Denton he might start me in the show
business again. But he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could find work for you at my
fish dock,” suggested Mr. Brown. And just
then Patter went silently up to the old man
and touched a cold nose to Mr. Stern’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that? Is that you, Tanza?”
Mr. Stern cried, and he seemed to have
aroused to new life. For the first time he
looked up at Mr. Brown, and then he looked
down at Patter.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that your dog?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“It’s my son’s and my little girl’s,” was the
answer. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. But for a moment I thought—but
it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters
now.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue, young as they were, felt
that something was wrong with the old man—something
strange and mysterious, it
seemed. And Mr. Brown wondered what he
meant by speaking that strange name “Tanza.”</p>

<p>“I brought my children and their dog to
cheer you up a little,” went on Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! It’s very good of you,” said the
old man. He was not ragged, as he had been
at first, since he was now wearing some garments
supplied by the hospital.</p>

<p>“My dog can do tricks,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Good tricks, too,” added Sue. “And
once he chased a cat and she had four white
feet and she rides on Patter’s back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! That’s very nice, my little
ones,” said the old man, and he smiled at
the children—not much of a smile, just a
trace, but it showed that he had been aroused
from his sad thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>By this time Patter in the sun parlor had
attracted the attention of the other patients.
There was a boy with a broken arm and a girl
who had something the matter with her leg
and could not walk. And these children
were delighted to see Patter. Nurses wheeled
them in chairs close to the dog.</p>

<p>“Shall I make him do some tricks?” asked
Bunny of his father.</p>

<p>“Yes, if it’s all right,” Mr. Brown answered,
looking at the nurse.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’ll be glad if you will,” she
said. “The patients here don’t get much
amusement.”</p>

<p>So Patter was put through his tricks. He
walked on his hind legs and on his front paws.
He sat up and then “said his prayers” on the
back of a chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a lovely dog!” cried the little
girl. “My dollie says her prayers just like
that!”</p>

<p>Just then Patter gave a bark, as he always
did when he had finished his “prayers.”</p>

<p>“Does your dollie bark like that?” asked
Mr. Brown of the little lame girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>She looked at him in a shy manner, and
then smiled as she answered:</p>

<p>“Dollies can’t bark!”</p>

<p>“I know that, my dear!” laughed Mr.
Brown. “I just asked you for fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, this dog is fun!” laughed the boy
with the broken arm.</p>

<p>Then Patter did more of his tricks. At the
one where he marched around with a stick
for a gun, Mr. Stern smiled and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you ever teach him to drive a horse?”</p>

<p>“No, but he can ride on my Toby pony’s
back,” answered Bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, if he can do that I think he can
drive your pony hitched to the cart,” said the
old man. “Try it some day. Put the dog
up on the seat and tie the lines in a loop
around his neck. Then teach him to put his
right paw on the right rein when he wants
the pony to turn to the right, and to put his
left paw on the left rein, to pull on that when
he wants Toby to turn to the left.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it can be done?” asked Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it can,” answered the old man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
“When I had my Tanza—but what’s the use
of talking about that?” and he sighed and
seemed more gloomy than at first.</p>

<p>However, Bunny and Sue did not notice
this very much and their father was glad, for
he did not want them to see the gloomy side of
hospital life.</p>

<p>Bunny put Patter through a few more
tricks, to the delight of the patients in the sun
parlor, and then it was time to go.</p>

<p>“I’ll come again in a few days and see how
you are,” said Mr. Brown to Mr. Stern, when
taking leave. “And when you are able to
work I’ll see that you get a place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’m good for much except
the circus or show business,” was his reply.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see about that,” said the children’s
father.</p>

<p>“Please come again and bring your dog,”
begged the boy with the broken arm.</p>

<p>“And maybe I’ll have my doll when you
come next time,” said the little lame girl.
“Then I’ll show you how she says her prayers.
But she doesn’t bark like a dog,” she added,
with a laugh at Mr. Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“All right!” he chuckled. “We’ll come
again.”</p>

<p>That Bunny, at least, knew there was something
strange about Mr. Stern was evident,
because on the way home Bunny asked his
father:</p>

<p>“What did he mean about Tanza?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Mr. Brown.
“But I’ll try to find out.”</p>

<p>However, the visit to the hospital gave
Bunny something new to think about—and
this was the trick of having Patter drive Toby
from the seat of the pony cart.</p>

<p>“He never can do it!” declared George
when Bunny spoke of it to his boy chums the
next day.</p>

<p>“Maybe he can,” said Charlie. “Let’s try.
It will be a dandy trick for the show if he’ll
do it.”</p>

<small>PATTER AND THE COWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby</span>, the Shetland pony, was peacefully
eating in his stable. He stopped chewing hay
to listen as he heard the sound of many feet
rushing into the barn. Then Toby whinnied
with pleasure as he heard the voice of Bunny
Brown. For Toby loved Bunny and Bunny
loved Toby.</p>

<p>“We’ll take Toby out and see if Patter will
do the trick of driving him,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“If he does it will be dandy for the show,”
said George. “But I don’t believe he will.”</p>

<p>“You said that when Bunny told us some
other tricks his dog could do,” remarked
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I did, but I don’t believe a
dog can drive a horse—not really drive and
guide him,” declared George.</p>

<p>“We can soon tell,” Bunny went on, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
opened the door of the part of the barn where
the pony was kept.</p>

<p>Toby heard the talk, but of course he did
not know what it all meant. However, he
knew enough to make sure that he was going
to be taken out into the sunshine and fresh
air. When Toby heard the voice of Bunny
or Sue it nearly always meant that he was to
give them a ride on his back or pull the cart.
And Toby was glad to do this, for it was no fun
to remain in the stable all day.</p>

<p>The little pony was led out into the stable
yard, and Patter, as usual, was waiting there.
As soon as Patter saw Toby the dog jumped
up on the pony’s back.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Wait a minute, Patter!”
cried Bunny, with a laugh. “We don’t want
you to do that trick to-day. We want you to
do a new one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you harness Toby to the cart,”
offered George.</p>

<p>While the boys were doing this Sue came
running out of the house.</p>

<p>“Bunny Brown, what are you going to do
with my pony?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“’Tisn’t all your pony,” replied her
brother.</p>

<p>“Well, half of him is. What are you doing
with my half?” asked Sue. “Course you can
do what you like with <i>your</i> half,” she went
on. “But you can’t hurt <i>my</i> half.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to hurt Toby,” Bunny explained.</p>

<p>“We’re just going to do a new trick with
him and Patter,” added Charlie.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it’s a trick, all right,” assented Sue.</p>

<p>Toby stood still, except for the switching
of his tail to drive away flies, until Bunny
and the boys had him hitched to the cart.
And twice, while this was going on, Patter
leaped up on Toby’s back and sat there.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t do that, Patter!” cried
Bunny, calling his dog down. “We don’t
want you to do that trick now. Wait a
minute.”</p>

<p>And when Patter jumped up again Sue
laughed and said:</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better hold him for you. As
long as Toby is here, Patter will think you
want him up on his back. I’ll hold the dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>When George saw how quickly Patter
obeyed Sue, the older boy had an idea.</p>

<p>“I think I know how we can teach Patter
to pull on the right rein or the left rein to
guide Toby,” he said.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” answered George. He
was beginning to think that, after all, the trick
might work.</p>

<p>When Toby was harnessed to the cart, Patter
was told to jump up on one of the side
seats and made to sit up there, in a begging
position. The reins were fastened around the
dog’s neck, and then with the boys and Sue
standing and looking on, Toby was started
straight down the drive.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right so far,” remarked
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Except he doesn’t make Toby go to the
right or the left,” objected Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot!” exclaimed Bunny. “Mr.
Stern said to put his right paw over the right
rein and his left paw over the left one. We
must do that.”</p>

<p>This was done, but still Patter did not pull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
on either rein, and all Toby did was to walk
straight ahead. It looked as though the dog
was driving, but he was not guiding the horse
as they wished him to do.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll show you what I thought of
doing,” said George. “Here, Bunny, you
stand on one side of the drive, part way
down.”</p>

<p>Toby was turned around and made to stand
at the beginning of the long driveway that led
out to the street from the barn. Patter still
remained on the seat, with the reins around
his neck. But instead of just putting his paws
on top of the reins, the boys made loops of
pieces of clothes line and slipped the dog’s
paws through them. So his paws were held
in position.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to stand here
for?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you in a minute,” George answered.
Then he said to Sue: “You go
down and stand opposite Bunny—on the other
side of the drive, you know.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sue, though she did not
know what it was all about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Now then,” went on George, “I’ll start
Toby down the drive. When he has gone a
little way, Bunny, you call Patter by his name.
But don’t call him enough so he’ll jump off
the seat.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” Charlie asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said George, “I think when Bunny,
standing on the left side of the driveway calls
Patter’s name, the dog will turn to him, and
that will make him press a little on the left
rein and Toby will go that way. Then if Sue
calls Patter from the right hand side of the
drive, Patter will turn to look at her, and his
right paw will press on the right rein and
Toby will turn that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a good idea!” cried Bunny
Brown.</p>

<p>So they tried it. First, though, when
Bunny called to the dog, Patter jumped right
off the seat and ran to his little master.</p>

<p>“No, no! You mustn’t do that!” and
Bunny shook his finger at his pet.</p>

<p>Also when Sue called, Patter did the same
thing—he jumped down off the seat. But
finally they got him to remain in place, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
his paws through the rope loops on the leather
reins that guided Toby.</p>

<p>Once again they started the pony down the
walk.</p>

<p>“Patter!” suddenly called Bunny, on the
left side. The dog gave a little bark, turned
his head toward the boy but did not jump off
the seat. And then, just as George had said,
the slight pull on the left rein made Toby
turn that way.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s guiding the pony! He’s really
driving!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“Now let me try!” begged Sue. So she
called Patter’s name and the dog turned
toward her, and also guided Toby in that
direction.</p>

<p>“Now we have a real trick!” exclaimed
George, and all the boys, as well as Sue,
thought George was very smart to think of it.
They made Toby and Patter do this new trick
several times to make sure it would work all
right. Then they let Patter get out of the
cart and Bunny gave his two pets—the pony
and the dog—some sweet crackers. For when
animals do tricks they expect to be rewarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“I guess we’ve got almost enough tricks
now to start the show,” said Bunny, a little
later.</p>

<p>“But we have to have more than just a pony
and a dog,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Sure!” agreed George. “We fellows will
bring all our pets and all the animals and
things we can get.”</p>

<p>“I can get some snakes,” offered Harry.</p>

<p>“They’ll be nice—I mean the people will
like to look at them, but we’ll have to keep
’em in a cage,” said George. “I’ll get my
alligator.”</p>

<p>After Toby was put back in the barn the
boys roamed over the fields, taking Patter
with them. And they talked about the coming
show.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was delighted when told that
evening after supper of how Toby and Patter
had done the driving trick suggested by the
poor old man in the hospital.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stern must know a lot about animals,”
said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“I think he does,” agreed Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Was Tanza an animal?” asked Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Who is Tanza?” asked her mother.</p>

<p>Then the children told her how the poor
man in the hospital had spoken that name, but
would not say what it meant. If Mr. Brown
could guess who it was he did not say.</p>

<p>“When are you going to give your show?”
asked Bunny’s father.</p>

<p>“In about a week, I guess. May we have
it in our barn?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The next day preparations for the show, in
which Patter was to play a big part, began.
Bunny’s chums came over every day to help
build seats in the barn and do other things to
make ready for the show.</p>

<p>One day when Bunny and his boy chums
were going across the fields to see another boy
who had a trained rooster they wanted in the
show, they saw a farmer running along as if
very much excited.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Mr. Boardman?”
asked Bunny, for he knew the farmer.</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” was the answer. “Look
up on that hill! See all the cows in my corn!
They’ll ruin my field if I don’t get ’em out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
soon, and it’s a long way to that hill—I can
never get there in time. Oh, look at ’em!”</p>

<p>From where he and the boys stood they
could look up on a distant hill, across a
canal used to float boats into Sandport Bay.
On the hill, in a field of corn, were many
cows.</p>

<p>“They broke through the fence,” said Mr.
Boardman. “If I don’t get them out soon
I’ll have no corn left, and it’s a long way
around to the bridge over the canal.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have Patter drive the cows for you,”
offered Bunny.</p>

<p>“How can you?” asked the farmer. “It’s
as far for the dog to go as it is for me, and it
will take you just as long.”</p>

<p>Bunny’s chums, as well as the farmer,
waited for the answer. What could Patter
do to the cows, far from them as he was and
with a deep canal of water between?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>SELLING TICKETS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> it was perhaps half a mile from
where Bunny and his chums and the farmer
stood to the field of corn where the cows were
causing such trouble, still the animals were
in plain sight, for they were up on top of a
hill. They could be seen walking in among
the rows of corn, tramping down much of it,
and eating what they wanted.</p>

<p>Bunny stooped down, took hold of Patter’s
head and turned it so the dog could look
straight at the distant cows in the corn. Then
Bunny spoke, while all the others kept silent.</p>

<p>“Patter, go drive those cows out! Chase ’em
out!” said Bunny. “Go chase the cows!”</p>

<p>Patter barked once or twice, fixed his eyes
sharply on the cows, and then, breaking away
from Bunny, ran to the canal, jumped in, and
swam across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>As soon as the dog was on the other side of
the water he began racing up the hill, barking
loudly all the while. From where they
stood, the boys and the farmer could watch
Patter plainly.</p>

<p>The dog ran the half mile distance much
more quickly than the boys or Mr. Boardman
could have done, even if they had swum over
the canal. Reaching the field of corn, Patter
rushed in, snapped at the legs of the cows, and
so barked at them and worried them, but without
hurting them, that they were glad to amble
out of the cornfield into the meadow where
they belonged.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a pretty smart trick!” exclaimed
the farmer. “I never saw a dog like
that before. He’d be valuable to me. What
will you sell him for, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“I’m never going to sell Patter!” declared
Bunny proudly.</p>

<p>“How did you make him drive out the
cows? I never saw him do it before!” exclaimed
George.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he could do it, either,” said
Charlie and Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Well, my mother told me about a dog her
father used to own when she was a little girl,”
said Bunny, as he and the boys walked along
with Mr. Boardman, who was going to mend
the fence so the cows couldn’t get out again.
“And this dog my grandfather had would
chase pigs out of a field when he saw them,
even if he was a long way off. So I thought
maybe if that dog would chase pigs, my dog
would chase cows—and he did.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did! I never saw a dog do
better!” chuckled the farmer. “Any time you
want to sell him, Bunny, I’ll buy him from
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m never going to sell him!”</p>

<p>“Anyhow he’s going to be in a show,” added
George.</p>

<p>“Who is, Bunny or his dog?” asked the
farmer.</p>

<p>“Both of us,” answered Bunny. “So is my
sister Sue, and our pony Toby, too.”</p>

<p>“We’re all going to be in the show,” added
Charlie. “We’re going to do tricks and
there’ll be an alligator and white rats——”</p>

<p>“And a trained rooster,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“The admission is ten cents,” said George.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a ticket right now!” exclaimed
the farmer, putting one hand in his pocket.
“In fact I’ll take two tickets and bring my
wife. It was worth more’n twenty cents to
have the cows driven out of my corn.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got any tickets ready yet,”
Bunny said.</p>

<p>“But we’ll be selling them in a few days,
and then we’ll bring you some,” added
George.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take two,” promised the
farmer.</p>

<p>The boys went with him up to the cornfield
on the hill, where Patter was still on guard
keeping out the cows. Then the fence was
mended so the animals could not again get out
of their pasture.</p>

<p>“Thanks, a whole lot, boys, for what you
and the dog did,” called Mr. Boardman, as
Bunny and his chums started away. “And
don’t forget—I want two show tickets.”</p>

<p>“We must get the tickets ready,” said
George to his chums, as they walked down
the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Maybe we could have ’em printed like
real tickets,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p>“Pete Gordon has a printing press,” announced
Bunny. “I guess he’d print ’em for
us, ’cause we buy most of our groceries from
his father.”</p>

<p>Pete Gordon was the son of the grocery
store owner, and when the boys explained to
him what they wanted he kindly promised to
print the tickets for them. When they were
ready the tickets looked like this:</p>

<p class="center">GRAND SHOW<br>
IN<br>
BUNNY BROWN’S BARN<br>
<br>
See the Trick Dog<br>
See the Trick Pony.<br>
SEE SISTER SUE<br>
————<br>
ADMISSION $10</p>

<p>That dollar sign in front of the 10 was a
mistake, Pete said, and he had not noticed it
until all the tickets were struck off. But, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
he explained to the boys, it didn’t really make
any difference.</p>

<p>“You can easily tell ’em it’s meant for ten
cents,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“And maybe it’s a good thing you did make
that mistake,” said George. “When folks get
a ten dollar ticket for ten cents they’ll think
it’s a bargain!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Bunny and his chums.</p>

<p>So they started out to sell tickets for the
show, in which Patter was to play a principal
part with Toby, the Shetland pony. But,
somehow or other, the tickets did not sell very
well. Many persons on whom the boys called
with them laughed and said, kindly enough:</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I don’t want any to-day. Come
around some other time, boys.”</p>

<p>Finally, after many had refused to buy, the
boys got together in Bunny’s barn to talk matters
over.</p>

<p>“Something has got to be done,” said
George seriously.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>LOST DOG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Everyone</span> had a different idea as to how the
tickets could best be sold, and when there
are half a dozen or more boys all talking at
once it is hard to get anything straight. Besides
Bunny and his three particular chums—George,
Harry and Charlie—a number of
other lads had been asked to help with the performance.
They had also tried to sell tickets,
but no one had had much luck.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman took the two he had promised
to buy, but if the boys wanted to make
money from the show—and of course they did—twenty
cents was not much.</p>

<p>So, as I have mentioned, the boys talked the
matter over, and each one had a different idea
of how to bring success. They talked so
much and said so many things that I have not
room for a quarter of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Finally George, being the oldest of the boys,
seemed to hit on the right idea.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, fellows,” he said,
“we’ll have to give this show for somebody.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—give it for somebody?”
asked Charlie. “Aren’t we giving it
for ourselves—for the fun of it, and to show
people what fine tricks Bunny’s dog and pony
can do?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” went on George. “We
must give the show for somebody else. You
know, when they had the fair, it was for the
church, and a lot of people came and spent
money when they wouldn’t go to the moving
pictures for fun. When Bunny and Sue gave
a show once before it was for Red Cross, and
lots of people came ’cause they knew their
money would go to Red Cross. And
now——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what you mean!” cried Bunny,
so eager that he did not beg pardon of George
for interrupting. “People think the money
is for us <i>kids</i> and they think <i>we</i> don’t need it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my idea!” said George. “Now if
we could say this show was for the benefit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
the Red Cross, or something like that, people
would buy a lot of tickets.”</p>

<p>“Come into the house and talk to my
mother,” suggested Bunny. “She knows a
lot, my mother does.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried the boys. I believe
they felt this same way about their own
mothers.</p>

<p>“My! what’s all this about? A raid on the
pantry?” cried Mrs. Brown, smiling, when
she saw Bunny leading his boy friends toward
the house.</p>

<p>“We want some advice,” said George.</p>

<p>“But if you have any cookies I guess we’d
like them, too,” said Bunny, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed his mother. “Perhaps
I can give you both. I am sure I can give
you cookies,” she went on, as she asked Mary
to bring out a large plate filled with sugar
and molasses disks. “As for advice, what
kind do you want?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the show,” explained Bunny.
“The tickets aren’t selling, and we want to
make money for some benefit.”</p>

<p>“I see,” remarked his mother. “Well, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
it happens, some ladies have just called on me
to ask me to help in raising money for a Home
for Crippled Children. We thought of giving
a fair, but if you boys want to give your
show for the benefit of the Home, I’m sure
the ladies would be glad to do all they could
to help you sell the tickets, since they would
raise money that way.”</p>

<p>“Just what we want!” cried George.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted Bunny. “I knew
mother could think of something!” he added.</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. Mrs. Brown
called on the telephone the ladies who had
been to see her, and they were very glad to
have the show of Bunny and Sue under their
charge. They at once appointed a committee
which would help sell the tickets.</p>

<p>“I guess maybe we’d better have new ones
printed,” suggested Bunny, when told that the
ladies would help. “That ten dollar mistake
on ’em doesn’t look very nice.”</p>

<p>“No, leave the tickets just as they are,” said
his father. “It’s a ‘kid’ show and people will
only laugh at the mistake. Besides, some men
I know will be glad to pay the price as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
stands on the ticket—I’ll make ’em,” he added,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Bunny. “Will somebody
pay <i>ten dollars</i> for a ticket?”</p>

<p>“They will when they know it is to help the
poor, crippled children,” answered his father.</p>

<p>And this proved to be true. More than one
man, whom Mr. Brown knew and spoke to
about the matter, gave a ten dollar bill gladly
for the crudely printed ticket, and some took
more than one, though they did not all intend
to come to the show.</p>

<p>Now that the boys could say the barn performance
was to be for the benefit of the
Home for Crippled Children the tickets sold
more quickly.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that before?”
asked one lady who at first had said she did
not care for tickets. “If it’s for the Home,
of course I’ll take one. Better give me three,”
and so the sale was made.</p>

<p>Then Bunny discovered another way to
make the tickets sell more quickly. He and
Sue, or perhaps some of the boys, would go to
a house and explain about the tickets. Nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
always the person spoken to would agree to
take at least one ticket.</p>

<p>“But where is it?” they would ask, when
Bunny or Sue made no motion toward handing
over the ticket.</p>

<p>“It will be here in just a minute,” Bunny
would answer.</p>

<p>Then he would give a whistle and around
the corner of the house would rush Patter with
the ticket in his mouth. The dog would sit
up on his hind legs in front of the one who
wanted the ticket and hold it out to be
taken.</p>

<p>“Oh, how cute!” was the general exclamation.
“I’ll take another ticket if your dog
will bring it to me in that way!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will!” Bunny would say.</p>

<p>Then Patter would go back around the corner
of the house, and when Bunny whistled,
Patter would come dashing back with another
ticket in his mouth. So, often, two were sold
where, had it not been for this trick, only one
would have been taken.</p>

<p>Of course it was just another of Patter’s
tricks. Some time before this Bunny and Sue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
had discovered that if one of them kept Patter
out of sight of the other, and gave him something
to hold in his mouth, when a whistle
was heard Patter would dash to find Sue or
Bunny—whoever whistled.</p>

<p>The children used to take Patter around the
corner of the barn. Bunny would hide himself,
and Sue would hold Patter by the collar,
after giving him something to hold in his
mouth. Then, at Bunny’s call, the dog would
rush away as soon as Sue let go his collar.</p>

<p>So when they wanted him to help sell admissions
for the show, they just put a ticket
in his mouth. They would do that before
knocking on the door or ringing the bell, and
then of course, when Bunny whistled, around
the corner would come rushing Patter with
the ticket.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the best things you ever thought
of,” said George.</p>

<p>While the ticket-selling was going on the
boys did not forget to make Patter, Wango,
and Toby practice their tricks. The monkey
seemed to like to swing on the trapeze with
the dog, and Mr. Winkler was glad to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
his pet do something for the aid of the Home
for Crippled Children.</p>

<p>As for Toby, he was always willing to do
what Bunny and Sue got him to do. And no
dog ever enjoyed tricks more than did Patter.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be great if we could put Toby
up on the trapeze and have Wango and Patter
both on his back,” said George in the barn
one day, after a practice.</p>

<p>“Why, Toby would break our trapeze! It
isn’t strong enough to hold him,” objected
Bunny.</p>

<p>“I know it isn’t now. But we could put
on more ropes,” said George.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Brown heard about this talk
he said:</p>

<p>“Nothing like that! It would be dangerous
to get Toby up on a swing or a trapeze.
It’s all right for the dog and the monkey, as
they’re not so heavy—but not Toby.”</p>

<p>So, with a sigh, George gave up that plan.</p>

<p>At last all was in readiness for the show,
which was but two days off now. Most of the
tickets had been sold, the seats had been put in
the barn, Bunny and Sue’s Uncle Tad, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
soldier, helping all he could. Patter and
Toby had been put through their tricks again
and again until they were nearly perfect. A
new clown suit and the silver and gold suit
had been made for Patter, and Bunny had
also sewed what he called the tramp suit.
Certainly it was very ragged.</p>

<p>And then, when the show was but two days
off, something dreadful happened.</p>

<p>One morning Bunny went out to the shed
where Patter slept each night, but could not
see his dog.</p>

<p>“Where’s Patter?” he asked Sue.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered. “Isn’t he in
his box?”</p>

<p>But there was no dog there, and the door
had been locked when Bunny opened it.</p>

<p>“Oh, where can Patter be?” cried Bunny
and Sue.</p>

<small>LOOKING FOR PATTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Children!</span> Children! Come in to breakfast!”
called Mrs. Brown, as she heard Bunny
and Sue out in the woodshed.</p>

<p>“We can’t come!” Bunny said.</p>

<p>“Why not?” his mother wanted to know.</p>

<p>“’Cause Patter is lost!” replied Sue.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! He isn’t lost! I guess he’s
just hiding from you for fun,” said Mr. Brown,
who was already sitting down to the
table, as he was in a hurry to get down to his
dock. The lobster boats were expected in
that morning.</p>

<p>“Patter is lost!” exclaimed Bunny. “I
locked him in here last night, and when I
opened the door this morning he wasn’t here.
He’s gone!”</p>

<p>Catching the note of tears in Bunny’s voice
and knowing that if Bunny cried Sue would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
do the same, also feeling that something might
have happened, Mr. Brown went out to the
shed.</p>

<p>As Bunny had reported, there was no trick
dog there to greet his friends. Whitefeet, the
pet kitten that Sue had adopted as her own,
rubbed up against the legs of the children as
if asking where Patter could be, but no dog
was in sight.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you locked the door last
night, Bunny?” his father asked him, as Sue
picked up Whitefeet to pet her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” was the answer. “I’m sure,
’cause it was locked this morning. Anyway, I
remember dropping the key after I took it out
of the lock last night.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown looked all around the shed
which was used to store kindling for the fires.
Then he stepped over to the window in the
back wall of the place and tried it. The window
was of the swinging type, hinged at the
top, like those in your cellar.</p>

<p>“Was this window fastened from the inside
last night, Bunny?” asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Why—I don’t know,” was the answer. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
guess I don’t ever fasten that window. Patter
couldn’t get out there; could he?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t your dog a pretty good jumper?”
went on Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a fine jumper,” said Sue. “You
ought to see him jump up on Toby’s back.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown pointed to a box under the
partly opened window.</p>

<p>“Is it any higher from there to the window
than from the ground to Toby’s back?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“It’s about the same,” Bunny answered.</p>

<p>“Then,” continued his father, “if Patter
could jump that far, why couldn’t he jump
out of the window?”</p>

<p>“But the window isn’t open very wide,” objected
Bunny. “It’s open only a crack, and
if Patter tried to jump up and go through the
crack he’d bump his head.”</p>

<p>“He would unless some one held the window
open from the outside so he could jump
through and out,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh! Do you think somebody took our
nice dog, Daddy?” asked Sue, with anxious
eyes fixed on her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Some one might have done so,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Who did?” demanded Bunny Brown and
his sister Sue.</p>

<p>“That’s what we have to find out,” said
Mr. Brown. “Come in now and eat your
breakfast Then I’ll help you look for
Patter.”</p>

<p>“Is their dog really gone?” asked Mrs.
Brown, as the three entered the house.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” admitted Mr. Brown. “But
I guess we’ll get him back.”</p>

<p>“In time for the show?” Bunny wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“That’s so—I’d forgotten about the show!”
exclaimed Mr. Brown. “Let’s see—when is
it?”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Daddy Brown. “We’ll
have to work fast.”</p>

<p>“What can you do if you don’t get Patter
back?” Mrs. Brown asked, as she passed the
breakfast oranges to Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to postpone the show, I guess,”
her husband replied. “It wouldn’t be much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
of a performance without Patter. He’s the
chief performer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve just got to find him!” cried
Bunny.</p>

<p>As you may imagine, neither the little boy
nor his sister had very good appetites for
breakfast. They were too worried about
their lost dog. Patter truly was gone—there
was no doubt of it.</p>

<p>After breakfast, even though he was in a
hurry to get to his fish dock to see about the
lobsters coming in, Mr. Brown remained
around the house long enough to help Bunny
and Sue search for their pet.</p>

<p>They looked in places where he had hidden
before, but he did not pop out at them
with joyous barks. They went over the fields
and lots near the house, but no Patter answered
to their calls and whistles.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown looked outside under the window
of the shed, through which it seemed that
Patter must have jumped to get away.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for, Daddy?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“I was seeing if there were any footprints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
there that might tell me who had been there
in the night,” answered Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“That’s like detectives do, isn’t it?” asked
Bunny, in a thrilled whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed his father. “But I guess I’m
not much of a detective, for I can’t see anything
except marks of the shoes of a lot of you
boys.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were playing around the shed yesterday,”
admitted Bunny.</p>

<p>“Will you tell the police?” asked Mrs.
Brown, when her husband was ready to go to
work, though a little late.</p>

<p>“I think I’d better,” he agreed. “It may
be that some strolling band of Gypsies took
Patter away, and the police keep pretty sharp
watch over these strollers. They’ll know
where they camp, and if any are around we’ll
go have a look and maybe find Patter.”</p>

<p>But no Gypsy bands had been around Bellemere
for some time, the police reported, so
it could not have been any of these wanderers
that had taken Patter. Of course the dog may
have wandered off and joined them, but this
did not seem possible. Patter was too happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
with Bunny and Sue to want to run away.</p>

<p>“Some one took him—that’s what they
did!” declared Sue, sobbing.</p>

<p>“And if I could find ’em I’d have ’em arrested!”
threatened Bunny.</p>

<p>News of the lost dog quickly spread, especially
among the boys and girls who were
helping Bunny and Sue get ready for the
show.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find him!” declared George.
“No trick dog—no show!”</p>

<p>“But where can we find him?” asked
Charlie Star.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to search!” declared George.
And then a frantic search began.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>LOST CHILDREN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> day long the search for the lost Patter
was kept up, but the trick dog could not be
found. Even some of the police and firemen
helped to look, when they were not on regular
duty. For the story of the tricks Patter was
going to do at the show in aid of the Home
for Crippled Children had spread all over
Bellemere, and many were anxious to help in
the search.</p>

<p>All about boys and girls were asking every
one they met, even strangers on the street:</p>

<p>“Have you seen Patter?”</p>

<p>And if the person inquired of asked in turn:</p>

<p>“Who is Patter?” the reply would come:</p>

<p>“He’s the trick dog of Bunny Brown and
his sister Sue.”</p>

<p>But in spite of all their looking that day,
Patter was not found.</p>

<p>Night came and Bunny and Sue, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
been out in turn with George, Charlie and
Harry, came back to their home. They were
tired and discouraged.</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll ever find him,
Mother?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so,” was the answer.
“Your father is going to put a notice in the
paper offering a reward to whoever finds Patter
and brings him home.”</p>

<p>“But if we don’t find him, what about the
show?” asked Bunny. “We have to have it
soon.”</p>

<p>“The show will have to be postponed if Patter
isn’t found,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Does that mean we can’t have it?”</p>

<p>“No, it means it will be put off and given
later. But don’t fret. Eat your suppers and
go to bed, and perhaps in the morning Patter
will be here.”</p>

<p>At supper Bunny and Sue ate a little better
than at breakfast because they had been outdoors
all day in the fresh air. After supper
they sat up a while before going to bed, hoping
some good news might come in over the
telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>But none came, though twice, when the
doorbell rang, the children rushed into the
hall, thinking it was some one coming with
the lost dog.</p>

<p>The first ring, however, was by a man looking
for a new family who had just moved on
the street, and the second time it was a woman
who called to return a pattern she had borrowed
of Mrs. Brown that morning.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I guess we’ll never find Patter!”
sighed Bunny.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s dead!” half sobbed Sue.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed their father. “Don’t
be so gloomy! You’ll have your dog back
soon.”</p>

<p>But there was no news and no sign of the
trick dog the next morning, though Bunny ran
to the shed as soon as he could slip out of bed
and downstairs.</p>

<p>“I dreamed in the night that he’d come
back,” said Sue, and she was much disappointed
when she found out the dream had not
come true.</p>

<p>After breakfast and after Mr. Brown
had telephoned to the police, only to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
they had no trace of the dog, Mrs. Brown
asked:</p>

<p>“What had we better do about the children’s
show? Some of the ladies on the committee
have been calling me up.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Brown slowly, “even if
we got Patter back now, he might be so frightened
over being lost that he would not do his
tricks well, and he’d spoil the performance.
I think the safest plan would be to call the
show off for a while. It can easily be given
later.”</p>

<p>So this was done, and an advertisement was
put in the paper, stating that because Patter
was lost the performance for the Home for
Crippled Children would take place later;
just when was not known, but there would be
a notice in the paper.</p>

<p>“Will the people want their ticket money
back?” asked Bunny, for quite a goodly sum
had been taken in from the sale of admissions.</p>

<p>“I think not,” his mother said. “People
don’t take back money they have given to
charity.”</p>

<p>And this proved to be the case. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
the boys offered to return it, no one asked to
have his money refunded, even though the
show was postponed.</p>

<p>The search for Patter went on for several
day without any result. At last one morning
Bunny whispered to Sue right after breakfast:</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s go off by ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Off where?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Off to find Patter. I think we can find
him alone by ourselves better’n all the others.
They make so much racket looking around
and yelling that maybe Patter is afraid to
come out.”</p>

<p>“Come out of where?” Sue wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Out of where he is hiding.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he is hiding, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he must be, Sue, else he’d have answered
some of my calls and whistles. He’s
hiding, or some one has hidden him. Come
on—let’s go and look for him—just you and
me.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sue. She usually
agreed with whatever Bunny said, and she
was quite willing to join in a search for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
missing dog. “What are you going to do?”
she asked, as she saw Bunny rummaging
around in the pantry.</p>

<p>“I’m getting something to eat,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Why, we just had breakfast, Bunny.”</p>

<p>“I know we did. This isn’t breakfast. It’s
for our dinner.”</p>

<p>“Dinner!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe we’ll be out looking for Patter
until away late this afternoon, and we’ll get
hungry,” explained Bunny. “So I’m going to
take something along.”</p>

<p>“Get some for me, then,” begged his sister.</p>

<p>Bunny did. He took some cookies and
cakes, though it would have been better if he
had taken some bread and peanut butter sandwiches.
But the cakes and cookies were
easier to carry.</p>

<p>“Come on now, we’ll go,” said Bunny, stuffing
the cookies and cakes into his pockets.
“But don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“’Cause! You think I want somebody to
see us and stop us? If they hear us they’ll say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
we oughtn’t to go and look for Patter all by
ourselves. But I guess we can find him.”</p>

<p>“I guess so, too,” agreed Sue.</p>

<p>Quietly the children went out the side door
to a porch that was not often used, and then
they scurried through the back yard to the
lots and vacant fields beyond.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll go find Patter!” declared
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Do you know where to look?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“No. But I guess maybe he’d go where
there was a lot of other dogs,” suggested
Bunny. “Maybe he was lonesome or he
wanted to learn new tricks for the show, and
so he went where he could talk to other dogs.”</p>

<p>“Dogs can’t talk!” declared Sue.</p>

<p>“Well, they almost can,” asserted her
brother. “Anyhow, they can waggle their
tails and it looks like talking. So I think Patter
went to find other dogs. And do you
know where most of the dogs are in this
town?”</p>

<p>“No! Where?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Down on River Street,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t a nice place!” cried Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Once daddy brought mother and me up from
the shore and we rode in the auto through
River Street. It was dirty, and such a lot of
dirty persons live there. There was a lot of
dogs, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bunny. “Maybe dirty people
always have a lot of extra dogs around.
Anyhow, down in River Street is the best
place to look. We can walk there, all right.”</p>

<p>River Street, as Sue had said, was the worst
section of Bellemere, and not a very safe place
after dark, as bad characters lived there, down
among the factories. But, as Bunny had remarked,
there were many dogs there, and Patter
might have taken it into his head to pay
them a visit. Or he might have been stolen
away and taken there.</p>

<p>So Bunny and Sue started for River Street.
It took them some little time to reach it, and
when they did they saw many dogs strolling
around. Once they thought they saw Patter
and they called and whistled.</p>

<p>But the dog proved to be a strange one, and
a boy shuffled up asking:</p>

<p>“That your dog?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“No,” answered Bunny. “I thought he
was, but he isn’t. My dog is a trick dog.”</p>

<p>“What color?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>Bunny described Patter and then the
strange boy, who was quite ragged and dirty,
said:</p>

<p>“Why, I think I know the very dog you’re
looking for. I saw him going down that
street a while ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” cried Bunny, as he and
Sue darted away.</p>

<p>“Did you really see their dog?” asked another
ragged urchin of the one who had
spoken to Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>“Naw, I don’t know nothin’ ’bout their
dog,” he snarled.</p>

<p>“What’d you tell ’em you did for?”</p>

<p>“Just to have some fun. We’ll see how
long they chase around looking for a trick
mut!”</p>

<p>The boy had played a mean trick, for fun,
as he thought. But it made trouble for
Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>The children searched the River Street
section and attracted much attention because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
they were well dressed—much better than the
boys and girls playing on the sidewalks. But
for all they walked and looked, no Patter
could they find.</p>

<p>“I—I guess we’d better go home, Bunny,”
said Sue, after a bit.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” agreed her brother.</p>

<p>They started out the right street, as they
thought, but they took so many twists and
turns they could not be sure. At last they
found themselves in a narrow, dirty and unpleasant
alley between high buildings.</p>

<p>“Where are we, Bunny?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” was his weary answer.
“I’m all turned around. I guess we came the
wrong way.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean we’re—lost, Bunny?” faltered
Sue.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” was the answer. “I’m
afraid we’re lost!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE OLD FACTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue Brown</span> stopped short and looked at
her brother Bunny. A strange look was in
the eyes of the little girl.</p>

<p>“Are we really lost?” she asked again.</p>

<p>“I’m ’fraid so,” Bunny replied again.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny Brown! What’d you want
to go and get me lost for?” wailed Sue.
“What’d you get me lost for?”</p>

<p>Bunny was quite surprised as he turned to
look at his sister.</p>

<p>“I didn’t get you lost,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, too!”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m lost, ain’t I? You said so yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I did. But I’m lost just as
much as you are!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sobbed Sue. “Oh, dear! I
don’t want to be lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“We won’t be lost very long,” promised
Bunny, as he took out his handkerchief and
tried to wipe away Sue’s tears. “I’ll take you
back home.”</p>

<p>“Stop it! Stop it!” suddenly cried Sue.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bunny, drawing
back. “I’m trying to sop up your tears.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re wiping ’em all over my face,
an’ I don’t like it. I can sop up my own
tears!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” and Bunny acted as if his
feelings were hurt. Then Sue felt sorry for
being a bit cross—as she was—and she said:</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, Bunny, you can sop up my
tears if you want to. But I guess I won’t cry
any more. Anyway, not if you can find the
way home.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find it all right,” declared the little
boy. “Here, I’ll take hold of your hand,
’cause maybe you can’t see very well, and I’ll
lead you.”</p>

<p>“I can see all right as soon as the tears dry
up out of my eyes,” said Sue. “I’m all right
now, but I was scared at first for being lost.”</p>

<p>“I was scared a little, too,” admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Bunny. “But I’m not scared now. Come
on, I guess we go this way to go home.”</p>

<p>Bunny thought he knew how to get out of
the alley between the big brick buildings and
find his way home, but he didn’t. It was a
part of Bellemere he had never before visited,
and it was strange to him. He walked to one
end of the alley and saw another, almost like it.</p>

<p>“I guess we go down here,” said Bunny to
his sister. Trustfully holding his hand, she
stepped along at his side. It was still and
quiet down among those big factory buildings.
Bunny knew they were factories, though what
had once been made in them he did not know.
Nothing was made there now, for the buildings
were deserted. Many windows were
broken, and doors were swinging to and fro
on half their hinges as the wind blew them.</p>

<p>Down the second alley walked the children.
They were not so frightened now.
Hope was in both their beating hearts, for
they thought they would come out on some
street that would lead them home, or at least
to some path by which they could reach their
father’s office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>But, to the surprise of Bunny and Sue, when
they reached the end of the second alley, instead
of finding that it led into a regular
street, they discovered that it turned into still
another alley.</p>

<p>“It’s like—now it’s like—a puzzle,” said
Sue, trying to find just the right word to describe
it.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is like a puzzle—or like that funny
thing—a maze I guess they call it—where
daddy took us once when we went to the big
fair,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“But how can we get out?” Sue wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“I guess we go this way,” her brother
answered.</p>

<p>They turned the next corner they reached,
and then they both stopped short in surprised
disappointment.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed his sister Sue.</p>

<p>“We’re right back in the same place from
which we started!” went on Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yep, the very same,” agreed Sue. “I can
tell by that pile of old tin cans,” and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
pointed to it at the side of the deserted factory.</p>

<p>And that is just what had happened. The
children had gone around in a perfect square,
walking through alleys that were on all four
sides of the old factory, and they had come
back to the same place whence they started.
It was very strange. It was worse than that—it
was frightening. Sue acted as if she were
going to cry again, and Bunny got out his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“You—you needn’t—I—I’m not going to
make any more tears,” said Sue, fighting to
keep them back.</p>

<p>“No, don’t,” begged Bunny. “You don’t
need to cry. I’ll take you home.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you would—right away!” exclaimed
Sue. “I don’t like it here and I’m
hungry and I don’t think Patter is here at
all!”</p>

<p>“No, Patter isn’t here,” agreed Bunny. “If
he was here he could show us the way out
pretty quick, I guess. But he isn’t here.”</p>

<p>For a few moments the little boy and girl
stood still, hardly knowing what to do. It
seemed of no use to walk along the alleys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
again, for they would only wander around
and around the old, deserted factory building.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud banging sound startled
both Bunny Brown and his Sister Sue. Sue
took a tighter hold of her brother’s hand.</p>

<p>“What was that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” Bunny answered.</p>

<p>Just then the sound came again. But
Bunny happened to be watching, and he saw
a door swinging in the wind. It was the old
door, slamming, that had made the banging
noise.</p>

<p>“That’s what it was,” and Bunny pointed.
“Just a door.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured Sue, and then she had an
idea. “Oh, Bunny,” she exclaimed, “maybe
if we went in the door—in the factory you
know—we could get out on the other side to
a street and go home that way.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Bunny. He was pretty
sure they would never get home by wandering
in the alley that led around and around. “All
right, Sue,” said her brother. “We’ll go in
the factory. I’d like to see what’s in it, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>Still hand in hand the two children passed
through the wind-swayed door. It was a
heavy one and the bottom hinge seemed to be
broken, for the door was tilted.</p>

<p>Once inside the children found the place
gloomy at first, but they walked on. They
were in a large room, which did not seem to
have any other doors or windows in it. But
there was a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>“I guess we have to go up those,” said
Bunny. “Then we can get out. Don’t be
afraid, Sue.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid now,” said Sue bravely.</p>

<p>Up the stairs went the children. What
would they find at the top?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>BLACK BOBBY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Luckily</span> the stairs in the old factory were
in good shape. If they had been broken or
so shaky that they would not have held up
Bunny and Sue, the children might have
fallen and been hurt.</p>

<p>But, as it was, Bunny and Sue reached the
top and found themselves in a hallway. As
there was no door leading from this, as far as
Bunny and Sue could see, they kept on walking
along the corridor. They made a turn
and found themselves in a small room which
had in it only one window.</p>

<p>“What we going to do now, Bunny?” asked
Sue.</p>

<p>“Well,” he slowly answered, as he looked
around. “I guess we got in the wrong place.
We can’t seem to get out of here. We’ll go
back downstairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>But as Bunny and Sue turned to do this
there came a puff of wind which swept
through the old factory where so many windows
were broken. The door of the room in
which the children now were standing suddenly
blew shut with a loud slam.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Sue.</p>

<p>“It’s only the door,” explained Bunny.
“I’ll open it and we’ll go back downstairs.”</p>

<p>He walked to the door and pulled on the
handle. It did not open the first time and
Bunny pulled again, harder this time. Still
the door did not open.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sue, coming to
her brother’s side.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just stuck, I guess,” he answered.</p>

<p>Again he pulled on the door as hard as he
could. But he could not open it.</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” offered Sue. But even with her
aid Bunny could not pull it open. “I guess
maybe it’s locked,” went on Sue.</p>

<p>“I guess maybe it is,” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>Still they did not give up. Again and
again Bunny and Sue pulled on the handle
until it became very certain that the door was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
locked. It was not merely stuck from tightness—it
was locked. Afterward the children
found that there was a spring lock on the outside
of the door and when it had blown shut
it became securely fastened. It could only
be opened from the outside.</p>

<p>It did not take Bunny and Sue very long to
know that they were locked in—locked in that
small room of the old, deserted factory. They
had made a mistake coming up the stairs, for
now they could not get out. There was no
other door in the room.</p>

<p>But there was a window!</p>

<p>Bunny turned to this as soon as he had found
out for a certainty that he could not open the
door. Like many other windows in the factory,
this one had most of its panes of glass
broken out. Part of the sash was also gone,
leaving an opening large enough for the boy
and girl to step through without being cut on
the jagged edges of the broken panes.</p>

<p>Bunny walked over to the window. Sue
followed him and asked what he was going
to do. For a moment her brother did not answer.
Then he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Look, here’s a fire escape! We can get
out on that!”</p>

<p>Built on the outside brick wall of the factory
was an iron balcony fire escape. One
could easily step out of the window to the
platform, which had a square hole in the center.
The platform was made of strips of
iron.</p>

<p>“We can just go down this even if the door
is locked,” said Bunny. “Come on, Sue.”</p>

<p>“Are there any stairs?” she asked.</p>

<p>“There’s a ladder,” said Bunny. “Fire escapes
don’t have stairs; they have ladders.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sue. “I can go up and
down a ladder. I go up and down the one in
our barn.” She had done this many times
when playing with Bunny and his chums or
her own girl friends.</p>

<p>Bunny stepped carefully out on the fire escape.
He had seen that the factory was old
and he thought perhaps the iron fire escape
might be so rusted as to fall with him. But
it bore his weight and seemed solid.</p>

<p>But when Bunny looked for the ladder that
should lead to the ground below, he was much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
disappointed not to see it. The ladder was
gone!</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sue, who was
still inside the factory near the window.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any ladder, and we can’t get
down,” her brother replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Sue. “Can’t we jump?”</p>

<p>“It’s too far,” answered Bunny. “Maybe I
can get the door open now. I’ll try again.”</p>

<p>He did try, but the door was still locked.
Then, almost ready to cry, the children went
out on the fire escape and looked around.
They could see a factory yard, littered with
broken machinery and old tins, and around it
all was a high fence. They could see no one
to whom to call for help.</p>

<p>Sue was just going to cry and Bunny was
trying to think of some way of jumping or
climbing down to go for help, leaving Sue
on the platform, when suddenly a man’s voice
called:</p>

<p>“What are you children doing there?”</p>

<p>Bunny looked down and saw a man in the
factory yard. He seemed to be a watchman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
or a caretaker, as, later, he proved to be.
Once more he called:</p>

<p>“What are you children doing there?”</p>

<p>“We’re lost,” explained Bunny. “We’re
looking for our trick dog, and we came in here
and a door slammed shut and there’s no ladder
to get down this fire escape.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said the man. “Yes, I know
about that door. It has a very strong lock
on it and I can’t get the key. But if you’ll
wait there a minute I’ll get you down.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a ladder and put it up to the fire
escape. That’s easier than trying to open the
inside door. Wait a minute, I’ll soon have
you down.”</p>

<p>The man hurried away, and Bunny and Sue
feared he might not come back. But he did,
and in a minute or two, carrying a ladder
which he put up to the fire escape platform.
Then he carried Bunny and Sue to the ground,
and very thankful they were to reach it
again.</p>

<p>“Now tell me all about it,” said the man.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue told about setting off in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
search of the lost Patter, relating how they
had wandered into the old factory.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I happened to come here
to-day,” said the man. “I’m hired by the
owners to keep a sort of watch over this place;
but I don’t come very often, for there isn’t
much left to take away. But I happened to
be passing just now and I thought I’d take a
look around. Now where do you want to
go?”</p>

<p>“We want to find Patter,” said Sue. “Do
you think you’ve seen our dog?”</p>

<p>“What sort of a dog was he?”</p>

<p>The children started to tell about their trick
pet, but they had mentioned only a few things
about him when the man, whose name was
Jacob Ward, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say, I believe I know where your dog is!
I saw him this morning. Or, if it isn’t Patter,
it’s a dog very much like him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, who has him?” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“A colored boy they call Black Bobby. I
know where he lives. He’s one of the chaps
that like to throw stones and break these factory
windows. Only there aren’t many more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
left to break,” chuckled Mr. Ward. “But
come on, I’ll take you to Black Bobby and
maybe he has your Patter.”</p>

<p>Their hearts filled with hope, Bunny and
Sue, holding Mr. Ward’s hands and eating the
cookies they had brought with them, went out
of the factory yard. Mr. Ward had no trouble
in getting out of the maze of alleys, and
soon Bunny and Sue saw the familiar bay, on
the shore of which was their father’s dock.</p>

<p>“Now I know where we are,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“We aren’t lost any more,” added Sue
thankfully.</p>

<p>“There’s where Black Bobby lives,” said
Mr. Ward, pointing to a ramshackle and tumble-down
house. “And here comes Black
Bobby himself,” he added, as a tall colored
boy, in ragged clothes, shuffled from the yard
into the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>THE RAGGEDY MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hello</span>, Bobby!” exclaimed Mr. Ward,
who seemed to know the colored boy. “What
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Nawthin’,” answered Black Bobby.</p>

<p>“That’s what you’re generally doing,”
chuckled Mr. Ward. “But say, Bobby, you
have a dog, haven’t you? A dog you found
the other day?”</p>

<p>“Ya’as, I got a dog,” answered Black
Bobby. “An’ he’s my dog, too. Nobody’s
goin’ to take him away.”</p>

<p>“Well, somebody took away a dog belonging
to this little girl and boy,” went on Mr.
Ward, “and they thought maybe their dog
was the one you found. We’d like to look at
him.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got their dog,” mumbled Black
Bobby, and he started to shuffle away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Just a minute now! Wait!” commanded
Mr. Ward so sharply that Black Bobby
turned and halted.</p>

<p>“Whut yo’ all want?” he asked, in a cross
voice.</p>

<p>“We want to see that dog you say you
found,” answered Mr. Ward. “He may be
Patter, the trick dog that belongs to Bunny
and Sue here. And if it’s their dog they can
take it.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t their dog and they can’t have it!”
snapped Black Bobby. “This dog don’t do
any tricks.”</p>

<p>“Our dog does!” declared Sue, who was
keeping close to Mr. Ward, for she was a little
afraid of Black Bobby, not because his face
was black, but because he seemed so unpleasant.</p>

<p>“Our dog does lots of tricks,” added Bunny.</p>

<p>Black Bobby stood sullenly, digging one
toe of his black foot into the sand. He looked
up and down the street as if getting ready to
run away, but as at one end of the street he
saw a policeman and as Mr. Ward stood
ready to grab him if he tried to dart off, Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Bobby seemed to think better of his idea of
escaping.</p>

<p>“This dog I got, he ain’t no trick dog,” said
the colored boy.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll take a look at him and make
sure,” said Mr. Ward. “Where is he,
Bobby? Now don’t try to fool me,” he added
sharply. “I know you and you know me.
And if I were to tell the police who broke
windows in the old factory, why, maybe,
Bobby, they might come looking for you,
the police might. Where’s the dog you
found?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t find him,” said Bobby crossly.</p>

<p>“Where did you get him then?”</p>

<p>“A fellah guv him to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he found him,” went on Mr.
Ward. “Come now, where is the dog?”</p>

<p>“He’s in my yard.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Mr. Ward to Bunny and
Sue. “I know where your yard is, Bobby.
Once I found in it some machinery that had
been stolen from the factory.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take it, Mr. Ward. Honest I
didn’t!” cried Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Well, maybe you didn’t,” admitted the
caretaker. “But show us the dog.”</p>

<p>After that Bobby seemed a little afraid, and
he led the way into the yard behind the ramshackle
old house where several colored families
lived. Bunny and Sue had never been
here before.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the yard a dog came
rushing from an old kennel in one corner.
But the dog did not come very far,
for he was held by a chain fastened to his
collar.</p>

<p>“That’s our dog! That’s our dog!” cried
Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s Patter! Oh, you dear Patter,
we’ve found you again!” cried Sue, and before
any one could stop her she had run forward
and was hugging the dog around his
neck. Then Bunny went to him, and it
seemed the dog would wag off his tail, so
happy was he.</p>

<p>“Oh, Patter! Patter! I’m so glad we found
you!” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“That ain’t your dog—he’s mine!” insisted
Black Bobby. “You can’t take him away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
either! He’s mine—a fellah guv him to me
an’ I’m goin’ to keep him!”</p>

<p>“Just a minute now,” said Mr. Ward.
“I’m not saying some other boy didn’t give
you this dog, Bobby, but, even if he did, he
may have had no right to. This seems to be
Bunny’s dog.”</p>

<p>“And mine, too,” added Bunny’s sister.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Sue’s,” agreed Mr. Ward. “Of
course they may be mistaken, Bobby,” he went
on, “for a great many dogs look alike. But
from the way this dog shows his joy on seeing
this little boy and girl, and from the fact that
he didn’t make any fuss over you, I’d say this
was the lost Patter.”</p>

<p>“His name ain’t Patter—it’s Nero!” grumbled
Black Bobby.</p>

<p>“Who gave him that name?” asked Mr.
Ward.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t prove anything,” went
on the watchman. “Now look here, Bobby,
if this is your dog he can do some tricks for
you. Call him to you. Take the chain off
and call him to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“All right! I’ll show you he’s my dog!”
insisted the colored boy. He took the chain
from the dog’s collar, but instead of going to
the colored boy when he whistled, the dog remained
with Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>“It looks as if he were their dog,” said Mr.
Ward. “But we’ll have another test. Can
you make that dog do any tricks, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“Naw! He can’t do no tricks yet, but I’m
goin’ to teach him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Patter can do lots of tricks; can’t he,
Bunny?” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“Sure he can,” said her brother. “Here,
I’ll make him do some. Say your prayers,
Patter!”</p>

<p>There was an old, broken chair in the yard,
and up in this jumped Patter. He put his
head down between his paws, as he had been
taught to do, and remained thus until Bunny
called:</p>

<p>“Amen!”</p>

<p>Up jumped Patter to frisk around Bunny
and Sue.</p>

<p>“Now what do you say to that, Bobby?”
asked Mr. Ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Nawthin’,” drawled the colored boy.
“But he’s my dog jest th’ same!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the watchman.
“Can you make your dog do any other tricks?”
he asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Lots of tricks,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“He’s going to do a pile of tricks in the
show,” said Sue. And then she added: “Oh,
Bunny, now we have Patter back we can give
the show!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bunny. “Here, I’ll make
Patter march like a soldier, and that’ll show
he’s our dog,” he said.</p>

<p>With a stick for a gun, Patter marched
around the yard. Then Bunny and Sue put
him through some of his other tricks until
Mr. Ward exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That’s enough! I’m sure he’s your Patter,
and you can take him away.”</p>

<p>“They can not!” cried Black Bobby. “He’s
my dog, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Bobby,” said Mr. Ward
sharply, “if you don’t give this dog up quietly
I’ll call the policeman in from the end of the
street. You know this dog isn’t yours, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
didn’t belong to the boy who gave it to you,
so he had no right to give it away. Now shall
I call the police?”</p>

<p>“Oh, take th’ ole dog!” growled Bobby, and
he turned aside as Bunny and Sue went out
of the yard, followed by the happy and frisking
Patter.</p>

<p>“We’re much obliged to you,” said Bunny
to the watchman.</p>

<p>“You were good to us, and I’ll tell my
mother and my daddy and they’ll thank you,”
added Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Mr. Ward, with
a smile. “I’m glad I could help you. But
do you know your way home now?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Maybe Patter can take us,” suggested Sue.</p>

<p>“No, that won’t do,” declared Mr. Ward,
seeing how uncertain the children were. “I’d
go with you myself, but I haven’t time. I
don’t want you to get lost again. I’d better
find a telephone and let your father know
where you are. That’s what I’ll do, I’ll telephone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” suddenly exclaimed Bunny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
pointing to a ragged man across the street
some distance away from the ruined factory.
“He’ll take us home! He knows where we
live. It’s Mr. Stern, and he was in the hospital
where we went.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the nice raggedy man!” laughed
Sue.</p>

<p>Indeed it was Mr. Stern, and his clothes
were rather ragged, even though they were
some that had been given him at the hospital.
He had been cured and was allowed to go.
He did not want to stay there any longer, being
a trouble, he said. And so, without letting
Mr. Brown know, the poor old man had
slipped away by himself.</p>

<p>Now, as he heard the cries of Bunny and
Sue, he looked across the street at them and
smiled. His eyes, too, rested lovingly on
Patter.</p>

<p>“Do you know where these children live
and could you take them home?” asked Mr.
Ward. “I would, but I haven’t time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can take them home,” said Mr.
Stern. “I’ll be glad to, as they were very kind
to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“All right then, I’ll leave them with you,”
said Mr. Ward.</p>

<p>On the way home Bunny and Sue told all
that had happened—how they had become
lost in searching for Patter and how they were
locked in the old factory. Whether Patter
had been stolen or had just jumped out and
wandered away was never found out.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you have your dog back,”
said Mr. Stern. “He is a good dog, and
valuable.”</p>

<p>He went as far as the children’s corner with
them, and when they were within sight of
their house he would have left them. But
Bunny and Sue caught hold of his hands and
would not let him go.</p>

<p>“Daddy and mother will want to see you,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Brown came out, looking for
her children, as they had been gone a long
time. She saw Mr. Stern, she heard the story,
and she insisted that he come into the
house.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have left the hospital without
telling us,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Oh, I didn’t want to make any bother,” he
murmured.</p>

<p>“But my husband wants to help you. He
can give you work.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one kind of work I’m good
for,” said Mr. Stern, with a sigh. “That is
in the show business. If I could find Jim
Denton—but I guess it’s of no use.”</p>

<p>“Well, you stay here until my husband
comes home,” said the children’s mother.</p>

<p>“And can’t you stay for our show?” asked
Bunny. “Now that we have Patter back
we’ll give the show!”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll stay,” agreed the old man,
wearily.</p>

<p>News of the finding of Patter soon spread,
and a crowd of boys and some girls came to
the Brown house to see the dog.</p>

<p>“We’ll let him rest awhile and then we’ll
practice him on his tricks and give the show,”
said Bunny. And this plan was carried out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>A GREAT SUCCESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the day of the “Great Show!” The
“ten dollar show,” as some of Mr. Brown’s
business friends called it because of the mistake
on the tickets. The barn had been fixed
up with seats, and there was a stage over
which had been erected the trapeze taken
from the haymow.</p>

<p>In cages around the barn had been placed
various animal pets of the boys and girls who
were chummy with Bunny Brown and his sister
Sue. These were not all trick animals.
There was a trained rooster though, about
which I shall tell you. And there were quite
a number of white mice and rats, as well as
one alligator, brought by George.</p>

<p>But the main part of the show was to be the
tricks done by Patter, Toby, and Wango, the
monkey.</p>

<p>At last all was in readiness, and after many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
whisperings behind it the curtain was finally
pulled aside. The curtain was made by some
old feed bags sewed together, but it answered
very well.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” began George
Watson, who had been chosen for stage manager,
“we will now start the great show with
a parade, and after that Bunny Brown will
do a lot of tricks.”</p>

<p>“And so will Patter! He’ll do tricks!”
cried the voice of Sue from back of the end
folds of the bag curtain. There was laughter
in the audience at this.</p>

<p>“All ready now!” called George, and then
out from the side, to the stage, which Bunker
Blue had built, marched Toby with Patter on
his back. And Toby drew a little cart in
which sat Wango, dressed up in a red suit and
a cap and a feather.</p>

<p>The people clapped at this, but there was
more to come. Bunny, dressed in a “tramp”
suit, followed the monkey cart, and then came
Sue, dressed as a fairy princess. Charlie Star
and Harry Bentley, who were to help with the
tricks, came out dressed like twins, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
George followed, carrying Whitefeet on a big
sofa cushion. There was more applause at
this sight.</p>

<p>After the procession the show proper began.
Bunny, dressed as a tramp, pretended he was
going to take Patter and Toby away, but Sue
rushed out and waved her fairy wand. Then
the ragged clothes fell off Bunny, for they had
been put on loosely for this purpose, and he
stood up in red tights, just like a real circus
actor. Mr. Stern had suggested this to the
children and they did this new trick almost at
the last moment.</p>

<p>Then Bunny put Patter, Toby, and Whitefeet
through their tricks. I have told so much
about the tricks all through this book that I
will not take the time to go over them again,
as there were no new ones.</p>

<p>But the people in the audience had not seen
the tricks before and they were much pleased
with them. After Patter, wearing his different
suits, had sat up and begged, had rolled
over, had pretended he was a soldier, had
said his prayers and walked on his front feet,
the trapeze was swung into place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>On the board fastened to the crossbar Patter
and Wango swung to and fro while the
audience laughed and clapped. Next Whitefeet
was put on Patter’s back, and the kitten
remained there as contentedly as she had on
the cushion when George carried her. Then
came the trick of Patter taking caps from the
tank of water.</p>

<p>The stage was now cleared so Patter could
do the trick of driving Toby hitched to the
pony cart. The dog sat up, his forepaws
through the rope loops of the reins. And
when Bunny on one side called, Patter guided
Toby that way. Then when Sue on the other
side called, Patter guided Toby that way,
much to the surprise of the audience who
thought the horse and dog were very smart
indeed.</p>

<p>In order not to have too many animal tricks,
Charlie and Harry did what they called “acrobatic
stunts.” They turned somersaults
holding to each other’s wrists and ankles, they
turned cartwheels, and did other things that
brought them applause.</p>

<p>Sue, too, was allowed to be on the stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
alone with Patter, and she put the dog through
some of his best tricks, all of which made a
“hit,” as the paper said afterward.</p>

<p>The show was much enjoyed by all who saw
it, and it had a funny, jolly ending. Sam
Cooper tried to do a trick with what was supposed
to be the trained rooster. Only the
rooster got wild, or frightened, or something,
and flew off the stage, out into the audience,
and lighted on the bald head of Mr. Gordon,
the grocer.</p>

<p>Perched on Mr. Gordon’s head, the rooster
uttered a loud crow! And you should have
heard the people laugh.</p>

<p>“But, anyhow, that was a good way to bring
the show to an end,” said George, as he pulled
the bag curtain over. “It made ’em all
laugh.”</p>

<p>The show was a great success, and quite a
large sum was taken in for the aid of the
Home for Crippled Children. Bunny, Sue
and their boy and girl chums who had helped,
were much pleased.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Bunny, you have a wonderful trick dog
there,” said Mr. Gordon, as he went out, rubbing
his bald head where the rooster had
scratched him a little.</p>

<p>“Indeed he is a valuable dog,” said Mr.
Stern, who had witnessed the show. “If I
had had Tanza here——”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you please tell us who Tanza is?”
begged Bunny.</p>

<p>“Is she a fairy?” Sue wanted to know.</p>

<p>“No, she was one of some trick dogs I once
owned,” said Mr. Stern, rather sadly. “I
earned my living by exhibiting my trick dogs.
Tanza was the best, but she died, and so did
all the others. Then I had no way of making
a living and I got hurt and became ill. I
thought if I could find Mr. Denton he might
give me a place in his show. But I can’t locate
him, and I don’t know what I’m going
to do.”</p>

<p>This talk took place after the show, when
Bunny and Sue were helping to clear up the
barn.</p>

<p>“I could make a place for you on my fish
dock,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” murmured the old man, “but
I’m afraid I wouldn’t know how to do that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
kind of work. If I only had a trick dog I
could go around as I used to. But I suppose
it’s of no use.”</p>

<p>A strange feeling came over Bunny Brown
and his sister Sue. They both had the same
idea at the same time. They looked at one
another and then at Patter, who was letting
Whitefeet rub up against him.</p>

<p>Bunny went over and whispered something
to his father.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Mr. Brown.
“You want to give up Patter?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bunny. “We want to
give our trick dog to Mr. Stern so he can go
around and earn a living again. Don’t we,
Sue?”</p>

<p>Sue did not answer for a moment, and when
she did there was just a little tear in each eye.</p>

<p>“Don’t we now—don’t we want to give Patter
to Mr. Stern?” asked Bunny again.</p>

<p>“Ye—ye—yes!” burst out Sue, and then,
after hugging Patter very hard, she ran out
of the barn. I think you can guess why.</p>

<p>Bunny said afterward that he “squeezed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
back” his tears as he led Patter up to Mr.
Stern and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Patter, you belong to him and you
can do your tricks for him and help him earn
money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I can’t take the children’s dog! I
wouldn’t dream of it!” cried the ragged man.</p>

<p>But in the end he was made to do this, since
it was the best way in which he could care for
himself, now that he was well from the automobile
accident. He was given some money
by the man whose car had struck him, and
with this Mr. Stern bought some new clothes
and was able to fit himself out so he could
travel around the country giving little shows
with Patter.</p>

<p>Of course Bunny and Sue felt very sad at
first, in giving up their trick dog, for they had
grown to love him very much.</p>

<p>“But,” said Bunny, “maybe we’ll see him
again when Mr. Stern gives his show here.”</p>

<p>“And,” added Sue, “we have to be good an’
make sackkelfices, like we learned in Sunday
school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Sackkelfices!” cried Bunny. “That’s
what they do in baseball!”</p>

<p>“’Tis not!” exclaimed Sue. “A sackkelfice
is what makes you feel good inside when you
don’t want to do it.”</p>

<p>And perhaps that is what a sacrifice might
be called.</p>

<p>At any rate, Mr. Stern took Patter away,
though I must admit that the parting with
Bunny and Sue was a tearful one. But then
the children had other pets to console them.
And Mr. Stern was able to earn his living by
showing off Patter and his tricks.</p>

<p>And so we have come to the end of the story
of the children and their trick dog, which
came to them so strangely, was lost, found, and
gone from them again. But this is not the
end of the adventures of Bunny Brown and
his sister Sue, for they have many others in
store.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
